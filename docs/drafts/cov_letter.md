Dear Editor in Chief,

Enclose please find a manuscript entitled "Importance of social-ecological fit for water management in large river basins: An analysis of institutional shifts in the Yellow River Basin", that we would like to submit as a *Research Article* for publication in *Global Environmental Change*.

Many of the world's large river basins face extremely serious competition for water resources (including the famous Colorado and Murray-Darling rivers), and setting water quota is a major instrument of governance. Curiously, the effectiveness of this institutional tool varies greatly, and the mechanisms involved are not yet well answered. The contrast between the Yellow River, China, a twice-shifted water allocation institution basin, where the first attempt at regime conversion appears to have been a complete failure, and the apparent success of the next, provides an excellent quasi-natural experiment for understanding the problem. Our study supports the importance of the structural configuration of social-ecological systems, demonstrating that simple structural changes can have unintended consequences.

According to the analysis mainly based on synthetic control method, an institution that was intended to prevent water overuse resulted in a social-ecological structural mismatch, leading to a sharp 164% increase beyond expected total water use, paradoxically. However, the next institutional shift to the integrated and unified regulation solved the ecological crisis of river drying up caused by sharp water use. From the mechanism, a novel application of an marginal benefits analysis suggested that this “sprint effect” and resulting ecological crisis were driven by incentive distortion that led to each province trying to pre-empt quotas for long-term gain. The solved crisis by re-align of social-ecological institution after then emphasize the significance of institutional matches. This analysis is not only of urgent relevance in light of China's ongoing attempts to restructure this much-publicised water allocation scheme, but is also inspiring in understanding and avoiding institutional mismatches in the world's large river basins.

This is an original paper and has not been published, nor is under consideration for the publication elsewhere. All the authors have read and approved the manuscript. The manuscript includes the main body of text with 4746 words, 4 figures and 1 table, a Supplementary Information text with 1725 words, 7 supporting figures and 1 supporting tables.
