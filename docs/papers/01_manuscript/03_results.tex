\label{result-1-p2}
Our estimation of theoretical water use suggests that the institutional shift in 1987 (87-WAS) stimulated the provinces to withdraw more water than would have been used without an institutional shift (Figure~\ref{main_results}A).
From 1988 to 1998, on average, while the estimation of annual water use only suggests $974.34$ billion $m^3$, the observed water use of the YRB provinces reached $1038.36$ billion $m^3$ in sum, $6.57\%$ increased.
However, after the institution shifted again in 1998 (98-UBR), the trend of increasing water use appeared to be effectively suppressed. From 1998 to 2008, the total observed water use decreased by $0.49$ billion $m^3/yr$ per year, while the estimation of water use still suggests $0.82$ billion $m^3/yr$ increases (Figure~\ref{main_results} B).
The increased water uses after 87-WAS aligns with the fact that badly drying-up of the surface streamflow from 1987 to 1998, which was an obvious touchstone of river degradation and environmental crisis (Figure~\ref{main_results}C).
On the other hand, the 98-UBR ended river depletion, despite the intensity of droughts still increasing for decades (from $0.47$ after 87-WAS to $0.62$ after 98-UBR on average) (Figure~\ref{main_results}C).

\subsection{Heterogeneous institutional effects}
\label{result-3}
% 结果2部分：展示区域相应差异
Our results also suggest differences between patterns of provinces in their responses to the two institutional regulating.
During the decade after the 87-WAS, the major water-using provinces (e.g., Inner Mongolia, Henan, Shandong) had apparent accelerations (Figure~\ref{regulating}).
The proportion of increased (or decreased) water use for each province (over the estimated water use by the model) has a significant correlation (partial correlation coefficient is $0.77$, $p<0.05$) to the actual water use from the Yellow River.
On average, the major water users (Shandong, Inner Mongolia, Henan, and Ningxia) used $32.14\%$ more water use than the prediction from 1987 to 1998.
By contrast, after the 98-UBR (from 1998 to 2008), almost all provinces have seen evident ($-16.54\%$ on average) declines in water use.
Furthermore, the regulated water use of provinces was irrelevant (partial correlation coefficient is $0.33$, $p>0.1$) with their water use from the Yellow River in proportions.

        Red (the 87-WAS) and green bars (the 98-UBR) denote an increased or decreased ratio for the actual water use over the estimation from the model in a decade after the institutional shift.
        The grey bars indicate the proportions of actual water use for each province to their total water use in a decade after the institutional shift.
        The triangles mark the water quotas assigned in the institution, scaled into ratios by dividing by their sum, too.
