Here, we use Differenced Synthetic Control (DSC) method, which considers economic growth and natural background, to estimate theoretical water use scenarios without basinal policy interferences (\textbf{Methods}; \textit{S2 in Supplementary Material}).
Our results suggest that the institutional shift in 1987 (87-WAS) stimulated the provinces to withdraw more water than would have been used without the interference (Figure~\ref{main_results}A).
From 1988 to 1998, while the estimation of water use only suggests $956.38 km^3$, the observed water use of the YRB provinces reached $1038.36 km^3$ in sum, $8.57\%$ increased.
However, after the institution shifted again in 1998 (98-UBR), the trend of increasing water use appeared to be effectively suppressed. From 1998 to 2008, the total observed water use decreased by $0.49 km^3$ per year, while the estimation of water use still suggests $1.03 km^3$ increases (Figure~\ref{main_results} B).
The increased water uses after 87-WAS aligns with the fact that badly drying-up of the surface streamflow from 1987 to 1998, which was an obvious touchstone of river degradation and environmental crisis (Figure~\ref{main_results}C).
On the other hand, the environmental crisis of river drying up was effectively resolved after the 98-UBR, though the density of droughts still increased for decades (from $0.47$ after 87-WAS to $0.62$ after 98-UBR on average) (Figure~\ref{main_results}C).
In line with previous literature had reported; therefore, the institution shift of 98-UBR contributed a lot to the successful water governance. %! citation

% P2: 主要介绍结果的意义、合理性
\label{result-1-p2}
Besides environmental background, our forecast by DSC takes economic factors into account under the assumptions that the production function between economic volume and water uses remained unchanged (\textit{S2 in Supplementary Material}).
It means the forecast of water use includes the part caused by the increased economic volume, while the outcomes of the economy (GDP in different sectors) of the YRB maintained a parallel trend with other regions during the period (\textit{S3 in Supplementary Material} Figure~\ref{S3-1}).
Therefore, 87-WAS did not ``have little effect'' as previous analyses suggested (cites) but led to increased water use because the difference between prediction and observation will be trivial when the shift was just a blank policy by applying the DSC method. %! Citation
Water use efficiency is another crucial factor in interpreting the differences besides the economic factors (e.g., irrigated areas and industrial outcomes) considered and controlled by the method.
In addition to the expansion of irrigation area after the 87-WAS, water uses per unit of irrigation area also rapidly widened the gap with the average level of the rest provinces. However, the industry water use intensity hardly changed (\textit{S3 in Supplementary Material} Figure~\ref{S3-2}).
As a previous report sigh: although the key to alleviating the drought is saving water in the irrigated areas, the tragedy of scrambling for water appeared in provinces and irrigated areas %! \cite{mao2000}.
In terms of the average ratio of water-saving irrigation area (refer to drip or sprinkler irrigation systems and canal lining), although there was a significant increase in the whole country after 1987, the YRB did not rapidly open a noticeable gap until about 1994 (Figure~\ref{S3-3}).
As a result, despite the irrigation area expanding, scrambling for water resources without any incentive to optimize water efficiency accelerated holistic water use.
This accelerated growth in water use was contrary to the original intention of the 87-WAS in conserving the limited water, and this failure of the institution was a major barrier to the sustainability of the Yellow River %! \cite{huangang2002}.

% 过去的研究总结出87-WAS收效甚微的几个因素，然而我们发现的机制

% 两次制度转变带来的级联效应存在巨大差异
The cascading effects of the two institutional shifts were very different, while their reframed SES structures have direct differences.
% 在我们的研究期间(从1975年到2008年)，机构在三种不同的结构之间转换:免费访问、87-WAS和98-UBR。
In our study period, the institution shifted between three different structures (Figure~\ref{structure} A to C).
% 长江水利委员会是长江流域的主要负责人，其任务是报告和分析1998年以前长江流域的用水量(87-WAS之后)。
However, the YRCC, whose primary official response to the river before 1998, the mandate was to conserve the riverway environment, construct and maintain infrastructures, and report on and analyze water consumption (after the 87-WAS) in the YRB, i.e., connecting the ecological nodes (different river reaches) horizontally ~\cite{wang2019a}.
% 这意味着，而与生态节点直接联系的各利益相关者之间没有横向连接。
Thus, until the institutional shift of 98-UBR, with no necessity to apply for a water permit from YRCC, there were no horizontal connections (cooperations or agreements) between the various stakeholders (provinces) directly connected to the ecological sections.
% 许多不同领域的经验研究指出这种结构很可能是错配的，因为这些利益相关者难以从全局出发维护好互相联系的生态系统。
Empirical studies in many different fields indicate that this structure is likely to be mismatched, as isolated stakeholders struggle with holistically maintaining interconnected ecosystems
\cite{sayles2017,sayles2019,cai2016,bergsten2019}.
% 87-WAS带来的效果再一次说明了这种阻碍可持续性的治理结构需要得到重视。
The cascading effect of the 87-WAS once again demonstrates that the more stakeholders, the more difficult it is to have a win-win situation of environment and interests \cite{hegwood2022} which calls for exceptional understanding and caution to the structure of hampering sustainability \cite{bergsten2019, sayles2019}.
