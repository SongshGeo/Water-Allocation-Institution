  abstract = {Net primary production (NPP) is the principal source of energy for ecosystems and, by extension, human populations that depend on them. The relationship between the supply and demand of NPP is important for the assessment of socio-ecological vulnerability. We present an analysis of the supply and demand of NPP in the Sahel using NPP estimates from the MODIS sensor and agri-environmental data from FAOSTAT. This synergistic approach allows for a spatially explicit estimation of human impact on ecosystems. We estimated the annual amount of NPP required to derive food, fuel and feed between 2000 and 2010 for 22 countries in subSaharan Africa. When comparing annual estimates of supply and demand of NPP, we found that demand increased from 0.44 PgC to 1.13 PgC, representing 19\% and 41\%, respectively, of available supply due to a 31\% increase in the human population between 2000 and 2010. The demand for NPP has been increasing at an annual rate of 2.2\% but NPP supply was near-constant with an inter-annual variability of approximately 1.7\%. Overall, there were statistically significant (p {$<$} 0.05) increases in the NPP of cropland (+6.0\%), woodland (+6.1\%) and grassland/ savanna (+9.4\%), and a decrease in the NPP of forests (-0.7\%). On the demand side, the largest increase was for food (20.4\%) followed by feed (16.7\%) and fuel (5.5\%). The supplydemand balance of NPP is a potentially important tool from the standpoint of sustainable development, and as an indicator of stresses on the environment stemming from increased consumption of biomass.},

  abstract = {Global climate change is projected to lead to an increase in both the areal extent and degree of aridity in the world's drylands. At the same time, the majority of drylands are located in developing countries where high population densities and rapid population growth place additional pressure on the ecosystem. Thus, drylands are particularly vulnerable to environmental changes and large-scale environmental degradation. However, little is known about the long-term functional response of vegetation to such changes induced by the interplay of complex human-environmental interactions. Here we use time series of satellite data to show how vegetation productivity in relation to water availability, which is a major aspect of vegetation functioning in tropical drylands, has changed over the past two decades. In total, one-third of tropical dryland ecosystems show significant (P {$<$} 0.05) changes in vegetation-rainfall sensitivity with pronounced differences between regions and continents. We identify population as the 01_manuscript driver of negative changes, especially for developing countries. This is contrasted by positive changes in vegetation-rainfall sensitivity in richer countries, probably resulting from favourable climatic conditions and/or caused by an intensification and expansion of human land management. Our results highlight geographic and economic differences in the relationship between vegetation-rainfall sensitivity and associated drivers in tropical drylands, marking an important step towards the identification, understanding and mitigation of potential negative effects from a changing world on ecosystems and human well-being. Drylands are under pressure from climate change and population growth. This study finds the sensitivity of dryland vegetation to rainfall changing, with opposite effects in poorer and richer nations.},

We exploit exogenous variation                     in both types of institutions driven by colonial history and document strong                     first-stage relationships between property rights institutions and the                     determinants of European colonization strategy (settler mortality and population                     density before colonization) and between contracting institutions and the                     identity of the colonizing power. Using this instrumental variables approach, we                     find that property rights institutions have a first-order effect on                     long-run economic growth, investment, and financial development.                     Contracting institutions appear to matter only for the form of financial                     intermediation. A possible explanation for this pattern is that individuals                     often find ways of altering the terms of their formal and informal contracts to                     avoid the adverse effects of weak contracting institutions but find it harder to                     mitigate the risk of expropriation in this way.},

There is a clear link between social and ecological resilience, particularly for social groups or communities that are dependent on ecological and environmental resources for their livelihoods. But it is not clear whether resilient ecosystems enable resilient communities in such situations. This article examines whether resilience is a useful characteristic for describing the social and economic situation of social groups and explores potential links between social resilience and ecological resilience. The origins of this interdisciplinary study in human ecology, ecological economics and rural sociology are reviewed, and a study of the impacts of ecological change on a resourcedependent community in contemporary coastal Vietnam in terms of the resilience of its institutions is outlined.},

  abstract = {Pervasive overuse and degradation of common pool resources (CPRs) is a global concern. To sustainably manage CPRs, effective governance institutions are essential. A large literature has developed to describe the institutional design features employed by communities that successfully manage their CPRs. Yet, these designs remain far from universally adopted. We focus on one prominent institutional design feature, community monitoring, and ask whether nongovernmental organizations or governments can facilitate its adoption and whether adoption of monitoring affects CPR use. To answer these questions, we implemented randomized controlled trials in six countries. The harmonized trials randomly assigned the introduction of community monitoring to 400 communities, with data collection in an additional 347 control communities. Most of the 400 communities adopted regular monitoring practices over the course of a year. In a meta-analysis of the experimental results from the six sites, we find that the community monitoring reduced CPR use and increased user satisfaction and knowledge by modest amounts. Our findings demonstrate that community monitoring can improve CPR management in disparate contexts, even when monitoring is externally initiated rather than homegrown. These findings provide guidance for the design of future programs and policies intended to develop monitoring capabilities in communities. Furthermore, our harmonized, multisite trial provides sustainability science with a new way to study the complexity of socioecological systems and builds generalizable insights about how to improve CPR management.},

For a way out, the paper examines the relative merits of statistical, comparative, and case study approaches to studying the commons. It ends with a plea for careful research design and sample selection, construction of causal mechanisms, and a shift toward comparative and statistical rather than single-case analyses. Such steps are necessary for a coherent, empirically-relevant theory of the commons.},

In a break from previous work on development which considered communities a hindrance to progressive social change, current writings champion the role of community in bringing about decentralization, meaningful participation, and conservation. But despite its recent popularity, the concept of community is rarely defined or carefully examined by those concerned with resource use and management. We seek to redress this omission by investigating ``community'' in work concerning resource conservation and management. We explore the conceptual origins of the community, and the ways the term has been deployed in writings on resource use. We then analyze those aspects of community most important to advocates for community's role in resource management \textemdash{} community as a small spatial unit, as a homogeneous social structure, and as shared norms \textemdash{} and indicate the weaknesses of these approaches. Finally, we suggest a more political approach: community must be examined in the context of development and conservation by focusing on the multiple interests and actors within communities, on how these actors influence decision-making, and on the internal and external institutions that shape the decision-making process. A focus on institutions rather than ``community'' is likely to be more fruitful for those interested in community-based natural resource management.},

After discussing briefly the major findings and accomplishments of the scholarship on the commons, the paper pursues two strategies of critique. The first strategy of friendly critique accepts the basic assumptions of most writings on common property to show that scholars of commons have discovered far more variables that potentially affect resource management than is possible to analyze carefully. The paper identifies some potential means to address the problem of too many variables. The second line of critique proceeds differently. It asks how analyses of common property might change, and what they need to consider, if they loosen assumptions about sovereign selves and apolitical property rights institutions. My examination of these questions concludes this review with an emphasis on the need to (a) attend more carefully to processes of subject formation, and (b) investigate common property arrangements and associated subject positions with greater historical depth.},

Their attributes are determined by the use of SA and their relations and connections are determined by the use of SNA. In the next step, five different classes for management of surface and groundwater in the study area are considered to draw social networks. Then, collaborative and conflictive formal (i.e. institutional) relationships between actors, and their intensity are investigated separately for each management class. The idea of independently considering collaborative and conflictive relations resulted in a better understanding of the governance system. Implementing the methodology for five different management classes and also regarding institutional relations by their nature and intensity provided more reliable results. In this paper, organizations are distinguished precisely, based on their own characteristics, and more importantly, their position in the system according to the others' perceptions. The combined use of SA and SNA for analyzing the governance of an environmental system has been done in a variety of scientific fields, but their results have never been compared to find probable correlations and analogies. In this paper, perhaps for the first time, a comprehensive statistical comparison between the results of SA and SNA is accomplished. An error index is also proposed for comparing the results of SA and SNA for the purpose of this research. Conclusions of the statistical analysis represent some rational and interesting correlations and similarities between the various features of these two well-known methods. Findings of the analysis can help to better understand the structure of these methods and to facilitate combining them in order to better analyze a complicated system of stakeholders.},

  abstract = {The Indus basin civilization (3000 \textendash 1500 BC) is thought to have collapsed due to the Indus river shifting its course, and unchecked salinization of the irrigated land. Though modern irrigation practices in the Indus basin do not have to worry about the river shifting its course, a priority concern should be the basin's salt profile. Despite attempts to deal with the problem since the 1960 s, the net result is still an increasing salt balance which threatens the system's sustainability. This paper explores what it means to manage risk, and then applies these insights to a narrative history of the Indus basin. Particular focus is placed on the basin's current management since it will shape how irrigation is managed in the future. A key lesson to derive is that given the short-term nature of decision-making in the basin, any significant change has to address the political reality whereby politicians exert influence over water allocations in order to safeguard their political lives.},

In this paper, we describe an approach that allows the mapping of SES by linking survey research with geographic information systems (GIS) to provide spatial representations of social and ecological system convergence. Using survey data that measured landscape values from multiple communities on the Kenai Peninsula, Alaska, we identify geographical areas where both human-perceived and physically measured ecological values overlap and are referred to as social\textendash ecological ``hotspots''. Community landscape values, collected as point data, were used to generate point density maps to produce hotspot surfaces for each value. These value surfaces were spatially cross-correlated with other communities' value surfaces and with an ecological map layer (net primary productivity) to demonstrate social\textendash ecological mapping. Moderate spatial cross-correlation coefficients were found between most landscape values by community with 18 hotspot surfaces pairings exhibiting strong positive spatial cross correlations. Moderately significant, positive linear relationships were found between perceived biological values and net primary productivity for three of six communities. The exploratory spatial analysis presented in this paper is a first step in identifying and describing the presence of SES in a regional context. We conclude the paper by discussing the potential managerial and ecological implications of coupled social\textendash ecological systems including system resilience and vulnerability, and the limitations of the approach that need to be considered.},

No basin-wide spatial conservation planning has been attempted to date, and the importance of coordinated conservation planning for the Nile's biodiversity remains unknown. We address these gaps by creating a basin-wide conservation plan for the Nile's freshwater fish. We identify priority areas for conservation action and compare cross-boundary collaboration scenarios for achieving biodiversity conservation targets, accounting for river connectivity. We found that collaborative conservation efforts are crucial for reducing conservation costs, saving 34\% of costs compared to an uncoordinated, business-as-usual scenario. While most Nile basin countries benefit from coordinating conservation planning, costs and benefits are unequally distributed. We identify ``hot spots'' consistently selected as conservation priority areas across all collaboration scenarios, and provide a framework for improving return on conservation investment for large and complex river systems globally. Basin-wide cooperation is crucial for cost-effective conservation of river Nile biodiversity. Basin-wide cooperation is crucial for cost-effective conservation of river Nile biodiversity.},

Developed initially for surface water, such indices are increasingly used to evaluate global groundwater resources. We compare indices of groundwater development stress for three major agricultural areas of the United States to information available from regional water budgets developed from detailed groundwater modeling. These comparisons illustrate the potential value of regional-scale analyses to supplement global hydrological models and GRACE analyses of groundwater depletion. Regional-scale analyses allow assessments of water stress that better account for scale effects, the dynamics of groundwater flow systems, the complexities of irrigated agricultural systems, and the laws, regulations, engineering, and socioeconomic factors that govern groundwater use. Strategic use of regional-scale models with global-scale analyses would greatly enhance knowledge of the global groundwater depletion problem.},

First, we show that the game on uniform hypergraphs corresponds to the replicator dynamics in the well-mixed limit, providing a formal theoretical foundation to study cooperation in networked groups. Second, we unveil how the presence of hubs and the coexistence of interactions in groups of different sizes affects the evolution of cooperation. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to extract the actual dependence of the synergy factor on the size of a group from real-world collaboration data in science and technology.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Climate change will impact every aspect of biophysical systems and society. However, unlike other components of the climate system, the impact of climate change on the groundwater system has only recently received attention. This focus is due to the realization that groundwater is a vital freshwater resource crucial to global food and water security, and is essential in sustaining ecosystems and human adaptation to climate variability and change. This paper synthesizes findings on the direct and indirect impacts of climate change on the entire groundwater system and each component. Also, we appraise the use of coupled groundwater-climate and land surface models in groundwater hydrology as a means of improving existing knowledge of climate change-groundwater interaction, finding that most models anticipate decreases in groundwater recharge, storage and levels, particularly in the arid/semi-arid tropics. Reducing uncertainties in future climate projections and improving our understanding of the physical processes underlying models to improve their simulation of real-world conditions remain a priority for climate and earth scientists. Despite the enormous progress made, there are still few and inadequate local and regional aquifer studies, especially in less developed regions. The paper proposes two key considerations. First, physical basis: the need for a deeper grasp of complex physical processes and feedback mechanism with the use of more sophisticated models. Second, the need to understand the socioeconomic dimensions of climate-groundwater interaction through multidisciplinary synergy, leading to the development of better adaptation strategies and groundwater-climate change adaptation modelling.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

This challenge can be viewed as a problem in which human society must navigate in a limited space of acceptable futures in which humans enjoy sufficient well-being and avoid crossing planetary boundaries. A critical obstacle is the nature of society as a controller with endogenous dynamics affected by knowledge, values, and decision-making fallacies. We outline an approach for analyzing the role of knowledge infrastructure in maintaining safe operating spaces. Using a classic natural resource problem as an illustration, we find that a small safe operating space exists that is insensitive to the type of policy implementation, while in general, a larger safe operating space exists which is dependent on the implementation of the "right" policy. Our analysis suggests the importance of considering societal response dynamics to varying policy instruments in defining the shape of safe operating spaces.},

We argue that voluntary local leaders play an important role in the initiation of self-governance institutions because such leaders can directly affect local users' perceived costs and benefits associated with self-rule. Drawing on recent work on leadership in organizational behavior, we propose that voluntary leaders can facilitate a cooperative process of local rule creation by exhibiting unselfish behavior and leading by example. We posit that such forms of leadership are particularly important when resource users are weakly motivated to act collectively, such as when confronted with ``creeping'' environmental problems. We test these ideas by using observations from a laboratory-in-the-field experiment with 128 users of forest commons in Bolivia and Uganda. We find that participants' agreement to create new rules was significantly stronger in group rounds where voluntary, unselfish leaders were present. We show that unselfish leadership actions make the biggest difference for rule creation under high levels of uncertainty, such as when the resource is in subtle decline and intragroup communication sparse.},

The differences in SWC were analyzed among different land-use types; and the SWC in different restoration years was also discussed using the method of space replacing time. Results indicated that (1) the differences in SWC between the two zones were lower in re-vegetated lands (2.76\%, forestland and 4.22\%, for shrub land) than in abandoned farmland (5.85\%). The differences in re-vegetated lands diminished gradually as the soil depth (0-300cm) increased, whereas the abandoned farmland represented an opposite trend. (2) Although the variation trends of SWC in abandoned farmland of the two zones were different as the restoration years increased, the differences in SWC between abandoned farmland and native grassland both diminished gradually. This meant the soil water deficit relative to native grassland would be alleviated as the progress of abandoned farmland. (3) As the restoration years increased, the differences in SWC between re-vegetated lands and native grassland increased gradually because of the continuous decrease of SWC in re-vegetated lands. The consequence will be that the soil water deficit in the re-vegetation lands is aggravated continually. From the perspective of soil water restoration and conservation in semi-arid areas, the abandoned farmland should be a more reasonable method than re-vegetated lands covered with introduced plants.

However, it is unclear about the synergy evolution of the FEW nexus in temporal and spatial scales. This paper uses the network analysis to explore the FEW nexus in China's Yangtze River Economic Belt. First, the comprehensive index system containing subsystems, order parameters and eigenvectors are determined in causal paths. Second, the synergetic network among order parameters is developed, and the centrality analysis is then conducted to identify the influencing factors. Third, the Bayesian network among eigenvectors is constructed to analyze the sensitivity of the dominant influencing factors. The results show that: (1) Energy subsystem has the highest centralities and dominates the FEW nexus. (2) From the perspective of time variability, the network centralization reaches the highest in 2007, but reaches the lowest in 2013, showing a downward trend, so we should adhere to the national strategy of synergetic development to realize the resource sustainability. (3) From the perspective of spatial sensitivity, Upper Reach is sensitive to food-related factors while Lower Reach is sensitive to energy-related factors. Therefore, the development of agriculture in UR should focus on protection, and the development of industry in LR should focus on remediation. The significance of the research is to construct a network analysis framework for better understanding the spatio-temporal variability of the FEW nexus in Yangtze River Economic Belt.},

We show how resilience can be estimated in terms of average life expectancy, accounting for this natural regime of variability. We use time series to fit a model that captures the stochastic as well as the deterministic components. The model is then used to estimate the mean exit time from the basin of attraction. This approach offers a fresh angle to anticipating the chance of a critical transition at a time when high-resolution time series are becoming increasingly available.},

This perspective suggests a generalization with two way (both unit and time) fixed effects, and both unit and time weights, which can be interpreted as a unit and time weighted version of the standard Difference In Differences (DID) estimator. We find that this new Synthetic Difference In Differences (SDID) estimator has attractive properties compared to the SC and DID estimators. Formally we show that our approach has double robustness properties: the SDID estimator is consistent under a wide variety of weighting schemes given a well-specified fixed effects model, and SDID is consistent with appropriately penalized SC weights when the basic fixed effects model is misspecified and instead the true data generating process involves a more general low-rank structure (e.g., a latent factor model). We also present results that justify standard inference based on weighted DID regression. Further generalizations include unit and time weighted factor models.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of the implications of climate change for global river flood risk. It is based on the estimation of flood frequency relationships at a grid resolution of 0.5x0.5 degrees, using a global hydrological model with climate scenarios derived from 21 climate models, together with projections of future population. Four indicators of the flood hazard are calculated; change in the magnitude and return period of flood peaks, flood-prone population and cropland exposed to substantial change in flood frequency, and a generalised measure of regional flood risk based on combining frequency curves with generic flood damage functions. Under one climate model, emissions and socioeconomic scenario (HadCM3 and SRES A1b), in 2050 the current 100-year flood would occur at least twice as frequently across 40\% of the globe, approximately 450 million flood-prone people and 430 thousand km(2) of flood-prone cropland would be exposed to a doubling of flood frequency, and global flood risk would increase by approximately 187\% over the risk in 2050 in the absence of climate change. There is strong regional variability (most adverse impacts would be in Asia), and considerable variability between climate models. In 2050, the range in increased exposure across 21 climate models under SRES A1b is 31-450 million people and 59 to 430 thousand km(2) of cropland, and the change in risk varies between -9 and +376\%. The paper presents impacts by region, and also presents relationships between change in global mean surface temperature and impacts on the global flood hazard. There are a number of caveats with the analysis; it is based on one global hydrological model only, the climate scenarios are constructed using pattern-scaling, and the precise impacts are sensitive to some of the assumptions in the definition and application.},

It assumes that agents differ, that they have imperfect information about other agents and must, therefore, try to make sense of the situation they face. Agents explore, react and constantly change their actions and strategies in response to the outcome they mutually create. The resulting outcome may not be in equilibrium and may display patterns and emergent phenomena not visible to equilibrium analysis. The economy becomes something not given and existing but constantly forming from a developing set of actions, strategies and beliefs \textemdash something not mechanistic, static, timeless and perfect but organic, always creating itself, alive and full of messy vitality.},

In spite of its water scarcity, the state of Arizona permits as much as 73\% of its water to be consumed by a single sector, crop production. Since 79\% of such crop production is not consumed in Arizona, it corresponds to exporting up to 67\% of the water available in the state to the rest of the country and abroad. It has certain and glooming consequences on the availability of water for a state expected to see its population grow and its climate get drier. Based on input-output techniques, we simulate three scenarios aiming at saving 19\% of the water available, a figure set by the first of them based on improving the efficiency of the current irrigation system. The same savings could also be reached by a twenty-seven-fold increase in the price of water or a 19.5\% reduction in crop exports. Estimates indicate that the least costly solution is a more efficient irrigation system while export reduction is the second-best choice.},

Two-third of these are informational and supportive policies, while regulatory and especially market-based options are less-often proposed. We assess the political feasibility and map the `theory of change' (TOC) through which the policies address tropical deforestation. Several feasible options exist, though most of these rely on less coercive\textemdash informational and cooperative\textemdash policy instruments. Most policy proposals lack an explicit and proven TOC, reducing their potential impact on reducing deforestation. Due diligence and multi-stakeholder fora stand out as policies that are feasible, yet rest on convincing TOCs. To increase the feasibility and impact of consumer-country deforestation policy options, we propose three principles: i) Build policies on a clear theory of change, ii) apply policy packaging and sequencing, and iii) work with stakeholders in key supply-chains and regions, broadening scope over time.},

  abstract = {Complexity of patterns is key information for human brain to differ objects of about the same size and shape. Like other innate human senses, the complexity perception cannot be easily quantified. We propose a transparent and universal machine method for estimating structural (effective) complexity of two-dimensional and three-dimensional patterns that can be straightforwardly generalized onto other classes of objects. It is based on multistep renormalization of the pattern of interest and computing the overlap between neighboring renormalized layers. This way, we can define a single number characterizing the structural complexity of an object. We apply this definition to quantify complexity of various magnetic patterns and demonstrate that not only does it reflect the intuitive feeling of what is ``complex'' and what is ``simple'' but also, can be used to accurately detect different phase transitions and gain information about dynamics of nonequilibrium systems. When employed for that, the proposed scheme is much simpler and numerically cheaper than the standard methods based on computing correlation functions or using machine learning techniques.},

  abstract = {Flooding in the Yellow River basin (YRB) has changed significantly over the last few decades because of climate change and human activities. Determining how the flooding changed and identifying the 01_manuscript driving factors of flood change is crucial to flood risk assessment and water resources planning. However, few studies have been conducted, especially in the whole YRB. To fill this gap, we investigate the spatial and temporal change of the annual maximum flood (AMAXF) in the YRB using observed data from 32 key hydrological stations (including 15 mainstream stations and 17 tributary stations). The Mann-Kendall test combined with trend index method is used to evaluate the trend in precipitation and AMAXF. The trend results indicate the AMAXF over the whole basin is dominated by decreasing trends: 72\% of the stations exhibit significant decreasing trends (at 0.1 significance level) and 22\% of the stations show no significant decreasing trends in the AMAXF. Both flood trends and abrupt change time exhibit obvious regional differences: the flood decreases is more pronounced in the midstream basins than in the headwater of the basin; the abrupt changes mainly occurred in the early 1990s for the upper reaches, and in the late 1990s for the middle reaches. To investigate the causes of flood change, the trends of precipitation extremes are analyzed in relation to the trends of peak floods. The analysis reveals that the decreasing precipitation extremes only results in the AMAXF reduction in the upstream basin. The decreasing AMAXF in the midstream and downstream of the basin are mainly attributable to the impacts of human activities (mainly including dam construction and soil conservation practices). In general, anthropogenic impacts play an increasingly important role in the AMAXF changes in the YRB. According to the possible changes in forcing factors, the AMAXF over the whole basin is expected to further decrease in the near future. However, there are still large flood risks in the tributary basins due to the collapse of check dams caused by extreme storms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {To solve the problems of decreasing water resources from the Yellow River, the renovation project of water-saving and controlling water distribution was implemented in the Hetao Irrigation District of North China since 1999. The local hydrological cycle is expected to be influenced or changed during the past fifteen years through the project. Jiefangzha Irrigation Region, the second large partition of the Hetao Irrigation District, was selected as the typical area to explore the relationship between agricultural water consumption, water distribution, cropping pattern and changing groundwater level. In this paper, the SEBS (Surface Energy Balance System) model and the ESTARFM (Enhanced Spatial and Temporal Adaptive Reflectance Fusion Model) algorithm were applied to produce daily field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) based on Landsat and MODIS data from 2000 to 2015 at intervals. The results indicate that the cropping pattern had changed greatly, while the water table descended through the years. The total agriculture ET stayed relatively stable, with the average annual consumption of 8.9 x 10(8) m(3). The temporal variation of agriculture ET was not obviously sensitive to the adjustment of cropping pattern. There was no significant difference in April-October ET for different crops, in spite of the clear distinction of ET in each crop-specific growing season. The spatial distribution of agricultural ET did not change in spite of the great adjustment of cropping pattern during fifteen years, which has a close inverse correlation with the groundwater depth. Groundwater depth descended from 1.76 m to 2.33 m during the operation period of the water-saving project, which might reduce the soil evaporation and have a positive effect on soil salinization effectively. Meanwhile, the net irrigation water use efficiency was improved from 0.59 to 0.66. These effects indicate the positive impact of the implemented water-saving renovation project on water management and environment. However, the actual crop coefficient K-c,K-a decreased slightly with the gradually increasing reference evapotranspiration, indicating possible drought stress as an effect of the continuing reduction of the availability of net irrigation water and declining groundwater table.

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Quantifying the combination of climatic and hydrological conditions required to generate groundwater recharge is challenging, yet of fundamental importance for groundwater resource management. Here we demonstrate a new unsaturated zone physical method of determining rainfall-recharge thresholds in karst using a regional cave drip water monitoring network. For limestones of the Upper and Lower Macleay Valley, eastern Australia, set in a subtropical climate, we observe thirty-one cave drip water recharge events over a five-year monitoring period. Comparison to antecedent precipitation demonstrates a median observed recharge threshold of 76~mm/week precipitation (Lower Macleay) and 79~mm/week precipitation (Upper Macleay), with lower precipitation thresholds (down to 30~mm/week) possible. We use a simple water budget model to quantify soil and epikarst water storage volumes and to test hypotheses of the hydrological controls. Modelled soil and epikarst water storage capacities of about 65~mm (Lower Macleay) and 80~mm (Upper Macleay) confirm a correspondence between observed weekly precipitation thresholds and soil and epikarst capacities. However, discrepancies between observed and simulated recharge events helps elucidate the likely recharge processes including focussed recharge bypassing the soil and epikarst store, overflow and drainage between multiple karst stores, and tree water use from depth. Our observed recharge thresholds and modelled soil and epikarst storage capacities are comparable to recharge thresholds estimated across a range of water-limited environments globally. The method is readily applicable to any karst region where drip loggers can be installed in a cave system in close proximity to surface climate data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Climate variability and land use/cover change have a significant impact on hydrological regimes, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, which have critical water shortage problems. Using the Mann-Kendall's test methodology, trends in hydro-climatic variables including precipitation, temperature, land use, and water balance indicators have been detected during the last 60 years in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). Generally, the MYRB has become much warmer and drier. Compared with 1980, the land use has also changed - to a small degree by 2000 and to a significant degree by 2015, with an increase in vegetation coverage. There are decreasing trends for streamflow and water resources and a shift in water balance, with less precipitation generating streamflow and more water being evaporated, especially after 2000. The response of water balance to climate change and land use/cover change, and the attribution for streamflow decrease was analyzed in the 10 sub-regions of the MYRB, based on the regionalization of parameter w of Fu's Formula. The results indicate that with an increase of E-0/P (potential evaporation/precipitation) or w, there is an increase of ET/P (evapotranspiration/precipitation) and a decrease of R/P (streamflow/precipitation). But, the increasing rate of ET/P decreases with an increase of E-0/P or w. Based on the "natural period" streamflow of 1956-1979, climate variability accounts for 75.8\% of streamflow decrease in 1980-2000. But in 2001-2016, land use/cover change is the 01_manuscript factor in streamflow decrease, accounting for 75.5\% of the decline. The results are useful for understanding what has happened and what will happen under climate change and land use/cover change, for adaption to future water resources management.},

This paper presents a new method for calculating wetland EWRs, which is based on the response of habitats to water level, and determines water level threshold through the functional integrity of habitats. Results show that in the Huanghe (Yellow) River Delta water levels between 5.0 m and 5.5 m are required to maintain the functional integrity of the wetland at a value higher than 0.7. One of the dominant plants in the delta, Phragmites australis, tolerates water level fluctuation of about +/- 0.25 m without the change in wetland functional integrity. The minimum, optimum and maximum EWRs for the Huanghe River Delta are 9.42 x 10(6) m(3), 15.56 x 10(6) m(3) and 24.12 x 10(6) m(3) with water levels of 5.0 m, 5.2 m and 5.5 m, corresponding to functional integrity indices of 0.70, 0.84 and 0.72, respectively. A wetland restoration program has been performed, which aims to meet these EWRs in attempt to recover from losses of up to 98\% in the delta's former wetland area.},

Socio-ecological solutions are needed to combat degradation and promote restoration. Important strategies include: increasing recognition of grasslands in global policy; developing standardized indicators of degradation; using scientific innovation for effective restoration at regional and landscape scales; and enhancing knowledge transfer and data sharing on restoration experiences. Stakeholder needs can be balanced through standardized assessment and shared understanding of the potential ecosystem service trade-offs in degraded and restored grasslands. The integration of these actions into sustainability policy will aid in halting degradation and enhancing restoration success, and protect the socio-economic, cultural and ecological benefits that grasslands provide.},

Adaptive and transformative actions are also related to social\textendash ecological network structures between people and ecological resources that enable learning and the internalization of ecological feedbacks. Agency is also key, yet we show that while perceived power may encourage adaptations, it may discourage more transformative actions.},

  abstract = {Social networks can profoundly affect human behavior, which is the primary force driving environmental change. However, empirical evidence linking microlevel social interactions to large-scale environmental outcomes has remained scarce. Here, we leverage comprehensive data on information-sharing networks among large-scale commercial tuna fishers to examine how social networks relate to shark bycatch, a global environmental issue. We demonstrate that the tendency for fishers to primarily share information within their ethnic group creates segregated networks that are strongly correlated with shark bycatch. However, some fishers share information across ethnic lines, and examinations of their bycatch rates show that network contacts are more strongly related to fishing behaviors than ethnicity. Our findings indicate that social networks are tied to actions that can directly impact marine ecosystems, and that biases toward within-group ties may impede the diffusion of sustainable behaviors. Importantly, our analysis suggests that enhanced communication channels across segregated fisher groups could have prevented the incidental catch of over 46,000 sharks between 2008 and 2012 in a single commercial fishery.},

  abstract = {Social networks are frequently cited as vital for facilitating successful adaptation and transformation in linked social-ecological systems to overcome pressing resource management challenges. Yet confusion remains over the precise nature of adaptation vs. transformation and the specific social network structures that facilitate these processes. Here, we adopt a network perspective to theorize a continuum of structural capacities in social-ecological systems that set the stage for effective adaptation and transformation. We begin by drawing on the resilience literature and the multilayered action situation to link processes of change in social-ecological systems to decision making across multiple layers of rules underpinning societal organization. We then present a framework that hypothesizes seven specific social-ecological network configurations that lay the structural foundation necessary for facilitating adaptation and transformation, given the type and magnitude of human action required. A key contribution of the framework is explicit consideration of how social networks relate to ecological structures and the particular environmental problem at hand. Of the seven configurations identified, three are linked to capacities conducive to adaptation and three to transformation, and one is hypothesized to be important for facilitating both processes. We discuss how our theoretical framework can be applied in practice by highlighting existing empirical examples from related environmental governance contexts. Further extension of our hypotheses, particularly as more data become available, can ultimately help guide the design of institutional arrangements to be more effective at dealing with change.},

However, there are multiple different understandings of this `approach', many of which misuse or omit key features of its foundations in natural science and economics. To address this, we present a framework for natural capital analysis and decision making that links ecological and economic perspectives.},

Existing assessments of spatio-temporal population are limited in their detail and geographical coverage, and the promising mobile-phone records are hindered by issues concerning availability and consistency. Here, we present a multi-layered dasymetric approach that combines official statistics with geospatial data from emerging sources to produce and validate a European Union-wide dataset of population grids taking into account intraday and monthly population variations at 1 km2 resolution. The results reproduce and systematically quantify known insights concerning the spatio-temporal population density structure of large European cities, whose daytime population we estimate to be, on average, 1.9 times higher than night~time in city centers.},

It also has been mentioned in UN Sustainable Development Goals 6 to ensure that all people will have equal access to both water and sanitation service, as well as embedded in Goal 10 that aims to reduce inequality and promoting inclusiveness. However, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme 2017 reported that 844 million people are still living without basic access to water, and 2.3 billion are still excluded from basic sanitation service. In this study, we present quantitative global-scale analysis of inequality of accessing the water and sanitation services from different wealth groups in 82 developing countries. We found that access inequality is rampant among developing countries particularly in terms of accessing basic sanitation service which the poor populations tend to be excluded in accessing the basic service. Based on combined multiple global data sets, we further identify which components of water governance are the key contributors to access inequality in water and sanitation services. We conclude that social and political dimension of water governance, such as government effectiveness, are influencing the occurrence of inequality of access to sanitation service in developing countries, while the inequality of access to basic water service was strongly influenced by the economic aspect of water governance, such as absorption of aid funds.},

  abstract = {Global consumption continues to generate growth in mining. In lesser developed economies, this growth offers the potential to generate new resources for development, but also creates challenges to sustainability in the regions in which extraction occurs. This context leads to debate on the institutional arrangements most likely to build synergies between mining, livelihoods, and development, and on the socio-political conditions under which such institutions can emerge. Building from a multiyear, three-country program of research projects, Peru, a global center of mining expansion, serves as an exemplar for analyzing the effects of extractive industry on livelihoods and the conditions under which arrangements favoring local sustainability might emerge. This program is guided by three emergent hypotheses in human-environmental sciences regarding the relationships among institutions, knowledge, learning, and sustainability. The research combines in-depth and comparative case study analysis, and uses mapping and spatial analysis, surveys, in-depth interviews, participant observation, and our own direct participation in public debates on the regulation of mining for development. The findings demonstrate the pressures that mining expansion has placed on water resources, livelihood assets, and social relationships. These pressures are a result of institutional conditions that separate the governance of mineral expansion, water resources, and local development, and of relationships of power that prioritize large scale investment over livelihood and environment. A further problem is the poor communication between mining sector knowledge systems and those of local populations. These results are consistent with themes recently elaborated in sustainability science.},

We provide estimates of public support for different types of climate agreements in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Using data from a large-scale experimental survey, we explore how three key dimensions of global climate cooperation\textemdash costs and distribution, participation, and enforcement\textemdash affect individuals' willingness to support these international efforts. We find that design features have significant effects on public support. Specifically, our results indicate that support is higher for global climate agreements that involve lower costs, distribute costs according to prominent fairness principles, encompass more countries, and include a small sanction if a country fails to meet its emissions reduction targets. In contrast to well-documented baseline differences in public support for climate mitigation efforts, opinion responds similarly to changes in climate policy design in all four countries. We also find that the effects of institutional design features can bring about decisive changes in the level of public support for a global climate agreement. Moreover, the results appear consistent with the view that the sensitivity of public support to design features reflects underlying norms of reciprocity and individuals' beliefs about the potential effectiveness of specific agreements.},

Whether aridification leads to gradual (versus abrupt) and systemic (versus specific) ecosystem changes is largely unknown. We investigated how 20 structural and functional ecosystem attributes respond to aridity in global drylands. Aridification led to systemic and abrupt changes in multiple ecosystem attributes. These changes occurred sequentially in three phases characterized by abrupt decays in plant productivity, soil fertility, and plant cover and richness at aridity values of 0.54, 0.7, and 0.8, respectively. More than 20\% of the terrestrial surface will cross one or several of these thresholds by 2100, which calls for immediate actions to minimize the negative impacts of aridification on essential ecosystem services for the more than 2 billion people living in drylands.},

  abstract = {Agent-based systems have been developed for many scientific applications and simulation studies to model a group of actors and their interactions based on behavioral rules. Agent-based models and multiagent systems simulate the emergence of system-level properties based on the actions of adaptive agents that interact with other agents, react to environmental signals, and optimize decisions to achieve individual goals. In water resources planning and management, agent-based modeling has been applied to explore, simulate, and predict the performance of infrastructure design and policy decisions as they are influenced by human decision making, behaviors, and adaptations. The goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive introduction to agent-based modeling for water resources researchers, students, and practitioners, and to explore water resources systems as complex adaptive systems that can be studied using agent-based modeling. Agent-based modeling is defined, and the characteristics of complex adaptive systems that necessitate its use are described. A literature review is presented to demonstrate research in the field that uses agent-based modeling to gain insight for water resources management. Two illustrative case studies of agent-based water resources systems models are developed and described. The case studies demonstrate the use of reactive and active (e.g.,~optimizing) agents for simulating water resources planning problems. The limitations in applying agent-based modeling and the insights that are expected from further investigations are summarized.},

There is striking consistency in the inferred human population dynamics across different regions of Britain and Ireland during the middle and later Holocene. Major cross-regional population downturns in population coincide with episodes of more abrupt change in North Atlantic climate and witness societal responses in food procurement as visible in directly dated plants and animals, often with moves toward hardier cereals, increased pastoralism, and/or gathered resources. For the Neolithic, this evidence questions existing models of wholly endogenous demographic boom\textendash bust. For the wider Holocene, it demonstrates that climate-related disruptions have been quasi-periodic drivers of societal and subsistence change.},

  abstract = {Multilayer networks are formed by several networks that interact with each other and co-evolve. Multilayer networks include social networks, financial markets, transportation systems, infrastructures and molecular networks and the brain. The multilayer structure of these networks strongly affects the properties of dynamical and stochastic processes defined on them, which can display unexpected characteristics. For example, interdependencies between different networks of a multilayer structure can cause cascades of failure events that can dramatically increase the fragility of these systems; spreading of diseases, opinions and ideas might take advantage of multilayer network topology and spread even when its single layers cannot sustain an epidemic when taken in isolation; diffusion on multilayer transportation networks can significantly speed up with respect to diffusion on single layers; finally, the interplay between multiplexity and controllability of multilayer networks is a problem with major consequences in financial, transportation, molecular biology and brain networks. This field is one of the most prosperous recent developments of Network Science and Data Science. Multilayer networks include multiplex networks, multi-slice temporal networks, networks of networks, interdependent networks. Multilayer networks are characterized by having a highly correlated multilayer network structure, providing a significant advantage for extracting information from them using multilayer network measures and centralities and community detection methods. The multilayer network dynamics (including percolation, epidemic spreading, diffusion, synchronization, game theory and control) is strongly affected by the multilayer network topology. This book will present a comprehensive account of this emerging field.},

The successful forestation programs implemented in China-which have improved the ecological environmental conditions-have gained the attention of many researchers and highlighted the relationship between forestation and water yields. The and and semi-arid Loess Plateau has received attention from water engineers and eco-hydrological researchers in China because of a shortage in water resources. We selected one of the oldest stations conducting soil and water conservation experiments, the Xifeng soil and water conservation station, and chose the Nanxiaohe catchment and its paired catchments (Yangjiagou catchment and Dongzhuanggou catchment) as our research areas. Trends in precipitation, air temperature, streamflow over the past 50 years, and the effect of changing land use on streamflow were analyzed. The Mann-Kendall test showed that precipitation had a negative trend (downward trend), whereas air temperature showed a positive trend (upward trend) from the past to present in the Nanxiaohe catchment. However, the trends seen in precipitation, air temperature did not contain any "jumping points." The paired catchment approach is used to detect the effects of land cover change on hydrology in the Yangjiagou and the contrast catchment, i.e., Dongzhuanggou catchment in our study. The results showed a large change in land use in the Yangjiagou catchment from 1954 to 2008. An increase in forested land (from 0\% to 40.08\% from 1954 to 2008) and a reduction of bare land (from 51.26\% to 5.50\% from 1954 to 2008) accounted for a large part of the change in land use. However, the land use changed little in the contrast catchment. The comparison of streamflow in the paired catchments showed that forestation reduced streamflow by 49.63\% (or 6.5 mm) each year.},

  abstract = {In many semiarid regions with irrigation, the depletion rate of groundwater resources has increased substantially during the last decades. A possible reason for this is that the price that users pay for their water does not reflect its scarcity and value. An alternative way to assess the perceived value of water is calculating its shadow price, which is defined here as the marginal value produced, and relates to the efficiency gain from current reallocation. Here we determine the shadow price of water used for irrigation for the most important groundwater-depleting countries and for four staple crops and one cash crop. To quantify the shadow price, the relation between the output and the water input is represented using production functions. We use globally available panel data on country-specific crop yields and prices together with crop-specific water consumption, calculated with the global hydrological model PCR-GLOBWB, to parameterize the production function by country and crop with econometric analyses. Our results show that the variation of shadow prices for staple crops within several countries is high, indicating economically inefficient use of water resources, including nonrenewable groundwater. We also analyze the effects of reallocating irrigation water between crops, showing that changes in water allocation could lead to either an increase in the economic efficiency of water use or large reductions in irrigation water consumption. Our study thus provides a hydroeconomic basis to stimulate sustainable use of finite groundwater resources globally.},

And yet, it is also clear that these institutions do not operate in a void but are enmeshed in larger, highly complex webs of governance arrangements. This compelling book conceptualises these broader structures as the 'architectures' of global governance. Here, over 40 international relations scholars offer an authoritative synthesis of a decade of research on global governance architectures with an empirical focus on protecting the environment and vital earth systems. They investigate the structural intricacies of earth system governance and explain how global architectures enable or hinder individual institutions and their overall effectiveness. The book offers much-needed conceptual clarity about key building blocks and structures of complex governance architectures, charts detailed directions for new research, and provides analytical groundwork for policy reform.This is one of a series of publications associated with the Earth System Governance Project.

Yet, it has also come under heavy scrutiny and been criticized. What is today's overall significance and impact of the notion of planetary boundaries for earth system science and earth system governance? We review here the development of the concept and address several lines of criticism, from earth system science, development studies, and science and technology studies. We also examine some applications of the framework, discuss broader governance implications, and reflect on actual policy relevance. In concluding, we explore the most recent incarnation of the planetary boundaries framework in its avatar as earth system targets supported by an Earth Commission.},

Most research indicates that forests reduce runoff but the degree of reduction is different at different sites. Data on precipitation, runoff depth, evapotranspiration and forest cover were collected for 67 watersheds through synthesizing published literature. Results suggest that afforestation on sparsely vegetated catchments reduces runoff and that this effect decreased with increasing forest cover. Annual runoff coefficients fluctuate around 4.1\%. Catchment scales influence the relationship between percent forest and runoff coefficient. We believe that afforestation-water yield relationships are variable. Large-scale watersheds may have a relatively high buffering capacity that masks forest cover effects on runoff because of a number of interacting factors. Results from this research will support the implementation of large-scale afforestation programs on the Loess Plateau.},

  abstract = {The study analyses the impact of climate change on streamflow regime of the Mahanadi River basin (MRB) in projected climate scenarios obtained from CMIP5 models. Projections from a total of 9 Global Climate Models (GCMs) were utilized. Integrated MIKE 11 NAM-HD, a conceptual hydrological model was employed to simulate the streamflow at Hirakud and Mundali gauging sites of upper Mahanadi River basin (UMRB) and middle Mahanadi River basin (MMRB), respectively. Prior to generating the streamflow regimes for the projected scenarios, GCM simulated precipitation and temperature were bias corrected using India Meteorological Department (IMD) observed gridded precipitation and temperature datasets. Precipitation was corrected using quantile mapping technique employing four different approaches, i.e., seasonal, hybrid, monthly non-hybrid, and monthly hybrid approaches. Hybrid approaches explicitly correct the extreme rainfall using Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution whereas Gamma distribution is used for normal rainfall. Temperature data was corrected using Gaussian distribution on daily basis employing monthwise time series. L-moments based frequency analysis method was used to estimate the 50-year return period rainfall for observed and bias corrected projected time series to assess the efficacy of bias correction methods in correcting the extreme events. Monthly hybrid approach was found to resolve rainfall climatology over both UMRB and MMRB with improved skill in extreme rainfall correction. Though, monthly non-hybrid approach produced the seasonal cycle of rainfall with highest accuracy, it performed poorly in correcting the extremes. Under projected climate scenarios mean annual rainfall is found to be increasing for BCC-CSM1.1(m), HadGEM2-AO, GFDL-CM3, and IPSL-CM5A-LR whereas other GCMs show mixed signal compared to their mean state of historic period (1976\textendash 2005). Streamflow regime in projected climate was analyzed using ensemble mean of simulated streamflow from identified GCMs. Mean monthly streamflow were overall found to be increasing towards the end of the century i.e., in far-future defined as 2070\textendash 2099. Daily high flows (defined at 5\% and 10\% exceedance probability) were found to be increasing in their magnitude and frequency in far-future whereas occurrences of low flows (defined at 90\% and 95\% exceedance probability) were found to be predominantly decreasing under projected climate.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Interactions between humans and the environment are occurring on a scale that has never previously been seen; the scale of human interaction with the water cycle, along with the coupling present between social and hydrological systems, means that decisions that impact water also impact people. Models are often used to assist in decision-making regarding hydrological systems, and so in order for effective decisions to be made regarding water resource management, these interactions and feedbacks should be accounted for in models used to analyse systems in which water and humans interact. This paper reviews literature surrounding aspects of socio-hydrological modelling. It begins with background information regarding the current state of socio-hydrology as a discipline, before covering reasons for modelling and potential applications. Some important concepts that underlie socio-hydrological modelling efforts are then discussed, including ways of viewing socio-hydrological systems, space and time in modelling, complexity, data and model conceptualisation. Several modelling approaches are described, the stages in their development detailed and their applicability to socio-hydrological cases discussed. Gaps in research are then highlighted to guide directions for future research. The review of literature suggests that the nature of socio-hydrological study, being interdisciplinary, focusing on complex interactions between human and natural systems, and dealing with long horizons, is such that modelling will always present a challenge; it is, however, the task of the modeller to use the wide range of tools afforded to them to overcome these challenges as much as possible. The focus in socio-hydrology is on understanding the human\textendash water system in a holistic sense, which differs from the problem solving focus of other water management fields, and as such models in socio-hydrology should be developed with a view to gaining new insight into these dynamics. There is an essential choice that socio-hydrological modellers face in deciding between representing individual system processes or viewing the system from a more abstracted level and modelling it as such; using these different approaches has implications for model development, applicability and the insight that they are capable of giving, and so the decision regarding how to model the system requires thorough consideration of, among other things, the nature of understanding that is sought.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Adverse social, psychological and economic consequences of a complete or near-complete lockdown demand the development of more moderate contact-reduction policies. Adopting a social network approach, we evaluate the effectiveness of three distancing strategies designed to keep the curve flat and aid compliance in a post-lockdown world. These are: limiting interaction to a few repeated contacts akin to forming social bubbles; seeking similarity across contacts; and strengthening communities via triadic strategies. We simulate stochastic infection curves incorporating core 01_manuscript from infection models, ideal-type social network models and statistical relational event models. We demonstrate that a strategic social network-based reduction of contact strongly enhances the effectiveness of social distancing measures while keeping risks lower. We provide scientific evidence for effective social distancing that can be applied in public health messaging and that can mitigate negative consequences of social isolation.},

  abstract = {Collaborative governance By its nature, environmental governance requires collaboration. However, studies have shown that various types of stakeholders often lack the willingness to deliberate and contribute to jointly negotiated solutions to common environmental problems. Bodin reviews studies and cases that elucidate when, if, and how collaboration can be effective and what kind of environmental problems are most fruitfully addressed in this way. The piece provides general conclusions about the benefits and constraints of collaborative approaches to environmental management and governance and points out that there remain substantial knowledge gaps and key areas where more research is needed. Science, this issue p. eaan1114 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDCurrent and future generations are confronted with the complex task of devising sustainable solutions to environmental problems. The coming decade might determine whether humanity will be able to set a course toward a future of continued prosperity on a planet whose ecosystems will deliver the needed goods and services. A crucial piece of this puzzle is achieving effective collaboration among different public and private actors and stakeholders. Calls for solving environmental problems through collaborative governance emphasize benefits from local to global scales\textemdash from artisanal fishermen avoiding the overfishing of local fish stocks by together agreeing upon sustainable practices, to states jointly committing to implement adequate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Although commonly advocated, achieving successful collaborations when confronted with complex environmental problems spanning geographical scales and jurisdictional boundaries is an area where substantial knowledge gaps remain. ADVANCESA growing amount of empirical evidence shows the effectiveness of actors engaged in different collaborative governance arrangements in addressing environmental problems. However, studies also show that actors sometimes collaborate only as a means of advocating their own interests, while largely lacking a willingness to contribute towards jointly negotiated solutions to common problems. Hence, collaboration is sometimes unable to deliver any tangible outcomes, or merely produces symbolic outcomes such as aggregated wish lists where conflicts of interest are left untouched.Clearly, no single blueprint exists for how to succeed by using collaborative approaches to solve environmental problems. One way of approaching this puzzle is through the lenses of the participating actors and the ways in which they engage in collaboration with each other. This approach entails directing attention to who the actors are, what their interests and motives are, who they collaborate with, and how the structures of such ``collaborative networks'' relate to the actors' joint abilities to address different environmental problems.Emerging insights from recent research suggest that the effectiveness of different collaborative network structures in addressing environmental problems depends on how those problems unfold with respect to the following characteristics: (i) varying levels of risk that actors free-ride on others' efforts; (ii) varying levels of knowledge gaps, signifying different needs for social learning and deliberation among actors with different backgrounds, experiences, and interests; and (iii) whether these problems are, for all practical purposes, permanent or just temporary.Also, long-standing research questions regarding whether governance structures that are adequately aligned with ecosystem structures and processes are more effective have recently been addressed empirically. Early results suggest several ways in which misalignments between the structure of a collaborative network and the biophysical environment reduce the ability to address environmental problems effectively. OUTLOOKA more nuanced understanding of whether collaborative governance is the most effective way of solving environmental problems is needed. The capacity of collaborative governance to deliver sustainable solutions for any given environmental problem ranges from highly effective to essentially worthless. Future efforts must establish which factors determine the exact location of any collaborative arrangement on this continuum.Emerging insights suggest that where a collaborative arrangement falls on the spectrum results from a complex interplay between several factors. The characteristics of the underlying collective action problem are one factor. Others are the characteristics of the underlying biophysical system and how these align with the ways in which collaborative governance arrangements are constructed, institutionally embedded, and managed. Finally, the patterns in which actors collaborate with each other (or do not) is a factor that potentially determines the effects that the other factors have on a collaborative arrangement's ability to solve environmental problems. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/357/6352/eaan1114/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Small-scale fishermen preparing their nets.Although collaborative approaches to environmental governance are increasingly advocated, a better understanding of if and how multiactor collaboration in interlinked social-ecological systems is able to effectively address various environmental problems is urgently needed.Photo: Nature Picture Library/Alamy Stock Photo Managing ecosystems is challenging because of the high number of stakeholders, the permeability of man-made political and jurisdictional demarcations in relation to the temporal and spatial extent of biophysical processes, and a limited understanding of complex ecosystem and societal dynamics. Given these conditions, collaborative governance is commonly put forward as the preferred means of addressing environmental problems. Under this paradigm, a deeper understanding of if, when, and how collaboration is effective, and when other means of addressing environmental problems are better suited, is needed. Interdisciplinary research on collaborative networks demonstrates that which actors get involved, with whom they collaborate, and in what ways they are tied to the structures of the ecosystems have profound implications on actors' abilities to address different types of environmental problems.},

  abstract = {How to create and adjust governing institutions so that they align (fit) with complex ecosystem processes and structures across scales is an issue of increasing concern in conservation. It is argued that lack of such social-ecological fit makes governance and conservation difficult, yet progress in explicitly defining and rigorously testing what constitutes a good fit has been limited. We used a novel modeling approach and data from case studies of fishery and forest conservation to empirically test presumed relationships between conservation outcomes and certain patterns of alignment of social-ecological interdependences. Our approach made it possible to analyze conservation outcome on a systems level while also providing information on how individual actors are positioned in the complex web of social-ecological interdependencies. We found that when actors who shared resources were also socially linked, conservation at the level of the whole social-ecological system was positively affected. When the scales at which individual actors used resources and the scale at which ecological resources were interconnected to other ecological resources were aligned through tightened feedback loops, conservation outcome was better than when they were not aligned. The analysis of individual actors' positions in the web of social-ecological interdependencies was helpful in understanding why a system has a certain level of social-ecological fit. Results of analysis of positions showed that different actors contributed in very different ways to achieve a certain fit and revealed some underlying difference between the actors, for example in terms of actors' varying rights to access and use different ecological resources.

In this review, we demonstrate how SNA has increased our understanding of the promises and pitfalls of collaborative approaches in addressing environmental problems. The potential of SNA to investigate conflicts in environmental governance, however, remains largely underutilized. Furthermore, a network perspective is not restricted to the social domain. A multilevel social-ecological network perspective facilitates integration of social and environmental sciences in understanding how different patterns of resource access can trigger both cooperation and conflict.},

  abstract = {Resent research has identified the existence of social networks as a common and important denominator in cases where different stakeholders have come together to effectively deal with natural resource problems and dilemmas. It has even been shown that social networks can be more important than the existence of formal institutions for effective enforcement and compliance with environmental regulations. However, all social networks are not created equal. On the contrary, the structural pattern of relations (i.e. the topology) of a social network can have significant impact on how actors actually behave. This clearly has implications for actors' abilities to manage environmental challenges. This review aims to add more precision to initial insights and pending hypotheses about the positive impacts of social networks on governance processes and outcomes, by reviewing and synthesizing empirically based literature explicitly studying structural characteristics of social networks in natural resource governance settings. It is shown that significant differences in governance processes and outcomes can be expected among networks experiencing structural differences in terms of density of relations, degree of cohesiveness, subgroup interconnectivity, and degree of network centralization. Furthermore, the review shows that none of these structural characteristics present a monotonically increasing positive effect on processes of importance for resource governance, and that favoring one characteristic likely occurs at the expense of another. Thus, assessing the most favorable level and mix of different network characteristics, where most of the positive governance effects are obtained while undesired effects are minimized, presents a key research and governance challenge.},

  abstract = {Ecological and socioeconomic processes often operate over different spatial and temporal scales. This can lead to increased risks of resource misuse and overexploitation if management is not well aligned with ecological processes operating in the landscape. One important way to ensure better alignment of social and ecological processes is through improved communication among relevant stakeholders operating at different scales and/or localities. Thus, understanding the structure and function of social networks is an important aspect of disentangling outcomes where different stakeholders come together to deal with natural resource dilemmas (Hum Ecol 34:573\textendash 592, 2006; Ecol Soc 11:18, 2006; Glob Environ Chang 19:366\textendash 374, 2009; Social networks and natural resource management: uncovering the social fabric of environmental governance, Cambridge, 2011). For example, active successful networking of a few key actors at the onset of a resource management initiative was important for building trust and buy-in from local farmers (Hum Ecol 34:573\textendash 592, 2006; Ecol Soc 11:18, 2006). Elsewhere, external connections were key to why some rural communities were more successful in initiating economic development; a few key individuals with enough education and skills had contacts with donors and agencies outside the village. These ties to external actors with resources were crucial in differentiating successful outcomes in otherwise very similar-seeming rural Indian communities (Active social capital. Tracing the roots of development and democracy, New York, 2002). In resource-dependent communities, particularly in the developing world, a lack of formal institutions or enforcement of regulations often means that resource users resort to informal social networks for coordinating resource use. To understand if and how social networks influence resource management, it is important to analyze both the patterns of communication but also how these patterns relate to key ecological processes in the landscape.},

  abstract = {Many services generated by forest ecosystems provide essential support for human well-being. However, the vulnerability of these services to environmental change such as forest fragmentation are still poorly understood. We present spatial modeling of the generation of ecosystem services in a human-dominated landscape where forest habitat patches, protected by local taboos, are located in a matrix of cultivated land in southern Madagascar. Two ecosystem services dependent on the forest habitats were addressed: (1) crop pollination services by wild and semidomesticated bees (Apoidea), essential for local crop production of, for example, beans, and (2) seed dispersal services based on the presence of ring-tailed lemurs (Lemur catta). We studied the vulnerability of these ecosystem services to a plausible scenario of successive destruction of the smallest habitat patches. Our results indicate that, in spite of the fragmented nature of the landscape, the fraction of the landscape presently covered by both crop pollination and seed dispersal services is surprisingly high. It seems that the taboo system, though indirectly and unintentionally, contributes to upholding the generation of these services by protecting the forest patches. Both services are, however, predicted to be very vulnerable to the successive removal of small patches. For crop pollination, the rate of decrease in cover was significant even when only the smallest habitat patches were removed. The capacity for seed dispersal across the landscape displayed several thresholds with habitat patch removal. Our results suggest that, in order to maintain capacity for seed dispersal across the landscape and crop pollination cover in southern Androy, the geographical location of the remaining forest patches is more crucial than their size. We argue that in heavily fragmented production landscapes, small forest patches should increasingly be viewed as essential for maintaining ecosystem services, such as agricultural production, and also should be considered in the ongoing process of tripling the area of protected habitats in Madagascar.},

The concept of the stakeholder is generally applied to parties that affect or are affected by the activities of private or public organizations. Distinct from shareholders, stakeholders are those individuals, entities or communities that have a connection with the activities of a corporation, a firm or an organization. The notion of the stakeholder is intimately linked to a conception of the business firm as an entity founded on negotiated governance, in which the maximization of value for the shareholder is not the ultimate criterion. In this model, issues and interests that are not directly associated with shareholders and investors, but which go beyond capital to encompass the concerns of civil society, are considered to be of central importance. This book provides a broad overview of stakeholder theory, presenting it as an ethical approach to strategic management that is both pragmatic and applicable to developing democratic practices within corporations, while at the same time suggesting ways in which 01_manuscript of a social contract can be elaborated within the context of globalization.},

Specifically, we use data from competitive auctions to estimate the effect that land-use regulation protecting endangered caribou in the Canadian province of Alberta has on the price producers pay for the right to extract oil. We exploit a regression discontinuity design to evaluate how prices differ along regulation boundaries that constrain resource development. The auction format and the regulation discontinuity allow us to measure the total cost of the regulation. We find that producers pay 24\% less on average for oil leases that are regulated and that the total net present value cost of the regulation exceeds \$1.15 billion for leases sold between 2003 and 2012, all of which is borne by the government. In spite of these costs, the populations of endangered caribou remain in widespread decline.},

In Alaska, repeated extreme weather events coupled with climate change-induced coastal erosion impact the habitability of entire communities. Community residents and government agencies concur that relocation is the only adaptation strategy that can protect lives and infrastructure. Community relocation stretches the financial and institutional capacity of existing governance institutions. Based on a comparative analysis of three Alaskan communities, Kivalina, Newtok, and Shishmaref, which have chosen to relocate, we examine the institutional constraints to relocation in the United States. We identify policy changes and components of a toolkit that can facilitate community-based adaptation when environmental events threaten people's lives and protection in place is not possible. Policy changes include amendment of the Stafford Act to include gradual geophysical processes, such as erosion, in the statutory definition of disaster and the creation of an adaptive governance framework to allow communities a continuum of responses from protection in place to community relocation. Key components of the toolkit are local leadership and integration of social and ecological well-being into adaptation planning.},

  abstract = {The water planetary boundary has been proposed to determine limits for a sustainable anthropogenic appropriation of freshwater. Aim of the present research was to summarise the water planetary boundary's development status and applications including its integration into Life Cycle Assessment and Environmentally-Extended Input-Output-Analysis. A systematic literature review was conducted for studies featuring the keywords ``planetary boundary'' and ``water consumption''. All pertinent studies were categorised as either revision, commentary, stand-alone application, the application within Life Cycle Assessment or application within Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Analysis and subsequently summarised and discussed. Overall, 35 studies from the period of 2009 until mid-2020 are subject of this review. Recent advancements such as spatially differentiated thresholds and refined sub-boundaries have addressed initial shortcomings of the concept of a water planetary boundary. Stand-alone applications of the water planetary boundary have either established local thresholds or allocated fair shares of afore-defined global thresholds. Several authors integrated the concept of a water planetary boundary into LCA e.g. via characterisation factors, weighting or normalisation, often under consideration of sharing principles. An application of the water planetary boundary into Environmentally-Extended Input-Output Analysis is less represented although some authors have demonstrated its powerfulness in investigating causes for the exceedance of local thresholds. For some of the reviewed studies, a link to the water planetary boundary remains rather vague as these studies merely investigate water availability in comparison to consumption. Although it should be applied with caution, the concept of a planetary boundary for freshwater use can contribute to understanding limits to sustainable freshwater consumption. Many studies established water use thresholds but refrained from analysing causative drivers in detail. Challenges for exploring this further include overcoming spatial and temporal mismatches of environmentally-extended economic accounts and hydrogeological data.},

However, there is a competing `confused learners' hypothesis: that individuals start the game either uncertain or mistaken (confused) and then learn from experience how to improve their payoff (payoff-based learning). Here we (1) show that these competing hypotheses can be differentiated by how they predict contributions should decline over time; and (2) use metadata from 237 published public goods games to test between these competing hypotheses. We found, as predicted by the confused learners hypothesis, that contributions declined faster when individuals had more influence over their own payoffs. This predicted relationship arises because more influence leads to a greater correlation between contributions and payoffs, facilitating learning. Our results suggest that humans, in general, are not altruistically motivated to benefit others but instead learn to help themselves.},

  abstract = {Expansion and contraction of desert margins around the globe have been inferred from a variety of proxy data and have since been linked, particularly in northern China and in the sub-Sahel, to changes in freshwater flux, vegetation cover, sea surface temperatures and, perhaps most importantly, monsoon circulations. We present a direct comparison of results from numerical general circulation model experiments for the mid-Holocene and for the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) with the climatic conditions that have been inferred from loess-paleosol sequences taken from the Chinese Loess Plateau. During the mid-Holocene in northern China, the northwestward migration of the southeast desert margin that has been suggested by grain size analysis is also expressed in the model results. There is a statistically significant wetting of the Plateau region, and increased soil moisture is a consequence of an enhanced summer monsoon whose latent heat release deepens the cyclonic Tibetan low and brings increased low-level convergence and precipitation to the area. North of the desert region, this circulation dries the soil through enhanced atmospheric subsidence, although the northern margin of the desert does not migrate significantly. Expansion of the desert margin toward the southeast at the LGM is small, but there is a statistically significant drying of the Plateau. The local hydrological cycle is reduced, and there is an increase in large-scale atmospheric subsidence over the region that is caused by the presence of the Fennoscandian ice sheet upwind. Model results therefore suggest that, in addition to local micro- and mesoclimatic conditions, regional effects, such as monsoon circulations and distal orography, are also important factors in determining the location of desert margins.

  abstract = {In 1999, the Government of China enforced a cross-provincial, quota-based Water Allocation Agreement that was developed in 1987 and titled Unified Water Flow Regulation (UWFR) to ensure that flow to the Yellow River mouth would not be cut off. This policy was in line with the refocus of the Government, over the last decade, on sustainable water use and keeping the Yellow River healthy. The policy enforcement ended more than two decades of flow-cutoffs, that is, periods when the Yellow River did not reach the Bohai Sea at its mouth, during an increasing number of days every year. While the UWFR was an important step forward in protecting the water resources in Northern China, the allocation did not take into account the value of water in various uses and water users who had to give up water resources, chiefly irrigators in the upstream and midstream provinces were not compensated. Could alternative water management options have brought about a better outcome for irrigators and the downstream ecosystem? We analyze this question using a Multi-Agent System (MAS) modeling framework for the Yellow River Basin (YRB). We find that compared to the baseline scenario simulating UWFR management, water trading among irrigation districts would result in a small decline in water consumption, a significant increase in agricultural GDP, and a small increase in total basin GDP. Overall GDP increase would be much higher if domestic and industrial uses became active water trading sectors.},

  abstract = {In this paper, general relationships of riverine bicarbonate concentrations and fluxes as a function of drainage basin mineral content and runoff are examined using a database of the 25 largest rivers in the world. Specific HCO3- flux normalized to unit basin area, which peaks in the mid latitudes, was found to be strongly correlated with the carbonate mineral content of river basins, while river HCO3- concentration was related to the balance of precipitation and evaporation. Within this global context, the weathering patterns of CO2 in a few large rivers (Changjiang, Huanghe, Pearl, and Mississippi rivers) were examined in further detail. The Zhujiang (Pearl River), especially its largest branch (Xijiang), was characterized by the highest specific weathering rate among all the world's large rivers due to an exceptionally high carbonate mineral content (over 80\%) in its drainage basin and its warm and wet environment. It has a moderate level of HCO3- concentration, however, due to dilution by relatively high precipitation in the watershed. In stark contrast, the Huanghe (Yellow River) has one of the lowest specific weathering rates because of low carbonate mineral content and a dry climate. However, it has a high HCO3- concentration due largely to the concentrating effects of high evaporative water loss, as a result of and weather and the agricultural use of water through irrigation systems, as well as carbonate-containing surficial deposits (i.e., loess). The strong correlation between specific HCO3- fluxes and discharge in all four rivers with different discharge seasonality suggests that higher precipitation in drainage basins promotes higher weathering rates. For the 25 large rivers studied here, rivers in low ({$<$} 30 degrees), mid (30-60 degrees) and high ({$>$} 60 degrees) latitudes have an average HCO3- concentration of 0.584, 1.649, and 1.154mM, respectively, and they account for 42.6\%, 47.3\% and 10.1\%, respectively, of the total global dissolved inorganic carbon flux to the ocean. Thus the mid-latitude rivers carry a disproportionally high dissolved inorganic carbon flux with a relatively small (26\%) amount of freshwater discharge. The discharge-averaged global river HCO3- concentration was estimated to be 1.1 mM. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We find that the most downstream county of a province has up to 20 percent more water-polluting activities than otherwise identical counties since 2001. Moreover, we find that the enforcement of pollution fee collection is more lenient in the most downstream county of a province, and that private firms contribute more to the downstream effect than state-owned enterprises and foreign firms. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the provincial governments respond to the pollution reduction mandates by shifting their enforcement efforts away from the most downstream county.},

We show that, once we isolate the temporal dimension of the decay, the attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function. We explain this universality by proposing a mathematical model based on communicative and cultural memory, which fits the data better than previously proposed log-normal and exponential models. Our results reveal that biographies remain in our communicative memory the longest (20-30 years) and music the shortest (about 5.6 years). These findings show that the average attention received by cultural products decays following a universal biexponential function.},

In this study, we propose an effective approach to estimate the spatial distribution and changes in the frozen soil using the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature products as inputs. A comparison with in-situ observations suggests that this method can accurately estimate the mean daily land surface temperature, the spatial distribution of the permafrost, and the maximum thickness of the seasonally-frozen ground in the source region of the Yellow River, located in the northeastern area of the QTP. The results of The Temperature at the Top of the Permafrost model indicates that the area of permafrost in the source region of the Yellow River decreased by 4.82\% in the period from 2003 to 2019, with an increase in the areal mean air temperature of 0.35 degrees C/10 years. A high spatial heterogeneity in the frozen soil changes was revealed. The basin-averaged active layer thickness of the permafrost increased at a rate of 5.46 cm/10 years, and the basin-averaged maximum thickness of the seasonally-frozen ground decreased at a rate of 3.66 cm/10 years. The uncertainties in calculating the mean daily land surface temperature and the soil's thermal conductivity were likely to influence the accuracy of the estimation of the spatial distribution of the permafrost and the maximum thickness of the seasonally-frozen ground, which highlight the importance of the better integration of field observations and multi-source remote sensing data in order to improve the modelling of frozen soil in the future. Overall, the approach proposed in this study may contribute to the improvement of the application of the MODIS land surface temperature data in the study of frozen soil changes in large catchments with limited in-situ observations in the QTP.},

Here, we discuss the potential links between China's historical large-scale afforestation practices and the program's effects on environmental restoration in arid and semi-arid regions in northern China based on a review of data from published papers, and offer recommendations to overcome the shortcomings of current environmental policy. Although afforestation is potentially an important approach for environmental restoration, current Chinese policy has not been tailored to local environmental conditions, leading to the use of inappropriate species and an overemphasis on tree and shrub planting, thereby compromising the ability to achieve environmental policy goals. China's huge investment to increase forest cover seems likely to exacerbate environmental degradation in environmentally fragile areas because it has ignored climate, pedological, hydrological, and landscape factors that would make a site unsuitable for afforestation. This has, in many cases, led to the deterioration of soil ecosystems and decreased vegetation cover, and has exacerbated water shortages. large-scale and long-term research is urgently needed to provide information that supports a more effective and flexible environmental restoration policy.

Many measures have been taken to increase the vegetation cover and to control soil erosion. Of these measures, the Grain for Green Project, launched in 1999, has been the most effective, changing the ecological and socio-economic situation of the Plateau significantly. Using time series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data from 1981 to 2013, this study analysed spatial patterns of changes in vegetation cover, detected spatial patterns of the abrupt-change time of NDVI trends, and investigated factors that may contribute to these changes. The results showed that (a) vegetation restoration was obvious over the last decades, especially in the 2000s, and the increase in NDVI during 2000-2013 was more than 3-times that during 1990-2000. Approximately 54.99\% of the Plateau during 2000-2013 had a statistically significant increase, mainly distributing in loess hilly and gully region and loess gully region. (b) Vegetation restoration was comprehensively affected by climate change and human activities (e.g., the Grain for Green Project, urbanization and policies), and the effects of each factor varied for different regions. (c) Vegetation in most of the Plateau began to increase around 2007-2010, and 4 discrete areas with different timings of such break points were detected. The difference in the timing of break points in NDVI may be related with precipitation, reproducing tree species, management measures, and survival rate.

Analysis focuses on technological diversification within the establishments of multilocational firms operating across Chinese cities. Overall, the results demonstrate that the knowledge structure of firms is more important than the knowledge structure of cities in shaping diversification within establishments. We show that rates of technological diversification vary according to plant status (headquarters or not), location (core or peripheral city), and on whether plants are introducing more or less complex knowledge.

The emergent concept of resilient livelihoods risks perpetuating problematic framings of both socio-ecological and livelihoods dynamics that limit the effectiveness of development and adaptation interventions. In this paper, I connect recent contributions to the livelihoods and socio-ecological resilience literatures to define resilient livelihoods as projects aimed at the achievement of well-being in a manner that preserves existing systems of meaning, order, and privilege. These projects (re)produce socio-ecologies, deeply human assemblages of socio-cultural and biotic 01_manuscript. So framed, the idea of resilient livelihoods centers meaning, power, difference, and agency in both livelihoods and socio-ecological dynamics. It opens up new understandings of the character, sources, and importance of resilience in livelihoods, allows for the identification of new indicators of livelihoods fragility, points to previously-overlooked sources of potential livelihoods transformation and change, and suggests sites of productive engagement between development and adaptation interventions and transformation and change.},

  abstract = {This paper presents and illustrates FlowLogo, an interactive modelling environment for developing coupled agent-based groundwater models (GW-ABMs). It allows users to simulate complex socioenvironmental couplings in groundwater systems, and to explore how desirable patterns of groundwater and social development can emerge from agent behaviours and interactions. GW-ABMs can be developed using a single piece of software, addressing common issues around data transfer and model analyses that arise when linking ABMs to existing groundwater codes. FlowLogo is based on a 2D finitedifference solution of the governing groundwater flow equations and a set of procedures to represent the most common types of stresses and boundary conditions of regional aquifer flow. The platform is illustrated using a synthetic example of an expanding agricultural region that depends on groundwater for irrigation. The implementation and analysis of scenarios from this example highlight the possibility to: (i) deploy agents at multiple scales of decision-making (farmers, waterworks, institutions), (ii) model feedbacks between agent behaviours and groundwater dynamics, and (iii) perform sensitivity and multirealisation analyses on social and physical factors. The FlowLogo interface allows interactively changing parameters using `tuneable' dials, which can adjust agent decisions and policy levers during simulations. This flexibility allows for live interaction with audiences (role-plays), in participatory workshops, public meetings, and as part of learning activities in classrooms. FlowLogo's interactive features and ease of use aim to facilitate the wider dissemination and independent validation of GW-ABMs.},

Institutions and policies alone however cannot guarantee that the right decisions are made. In this chapter, we argue that sound decisions must overcome the ethical dilemmas that experts face when encapsulating hypotheses of the real-world into numerical models. Using groundwater as an example, we show how the so-called complicity ethic may unfold during the process of designing management and policy interventions, and subsequently recommend eight guiding principles (a charter) that can be followed to reduce the likelihood that this complicity ethic takes place. We then introduce The Collaborative Pathway\textemdash a mediated modelling activity that synergistically blends the eight guiding principles of our ethics charter into a practical decision-making process. This approach is designed to foster community engagement, to improve the way sectoral risks and trade-offs are evaluated, and to help stakeholders understand what might drive a particular sector towards best- and worst-case outcomes. If done right and with the right tools and strategies, The Collaborative Pathway can become a useful framework to encode ethics, resilience, and sustainability in our decisions relating to the development and protection of any common-pool resource that maintains our humanity.},

Although a third of Earth's largest groundwater basins are being depleted by irrigated agriculture2, little is known about the conditions that lead resource users to comply with conservation policies. Here we developed an agent-based model3,4of irrigated agriculture rooted in principles of cooperation5,6and collective action7and grounded on the World Values Survey Wave 6 (n\,=\,90,350). Simulations of three major aquifer systems facing unsustainable demands reveal tipping points where social norms towards groundwater conservation shift abruptly with small changes in cultural values and monitoring and enforcement provisions. These tipping points are amplified by group size and best invoked by engaging a minority of rule followers. Overall, we present a powerful tool for evaluating the contingency of regulatory compliance upon cultural, socioeconomic, institutional and physical conditions, and its susceptibility to change beyond thresholds. Managing these thresholds may help to avoid unsustainable groundwater development, reduce enforcement costs, better account for cultural diversity in transboundary aquifer management and increase community resilience to changes in regional climate. Although we focus on groundwater, our methods and findings apply broadly to other resource management issues.},

  abstract = {Groundwater depletion is arguably one of humanity's greatest sustainability challenges of the 21st century. With Sustainable Development Goals only a decade away, water authorities around the world are in the urgent need for concrete and targeted measures to ensure that communities adhere to groundwater management policies as rapidly and as effectively as possible. In this paper, we combine computational social science, groundwater modelling and empirical data from the World Values Survey to generate future ensembles of hydro-social trajectories under alternative courses of management and social action or inaction. Our simulations shed new light on the role that cultural values can play in shaping the societal trajectories and norms that emerge when resources are either allocated or not sufficiently allocated to monitor compliance, issue fines, engage community leaders, and deter rule-breakers. This study presents a new approach to explore and evaluate the capacity of existing and future management actions to steer groundwater systems towards sustainable trajectories, to forecast the celerity and timing of social transformations at the inter-decadal scale, and to help nations identify the most pertinent management options under institutional, political, social, and/or cultural constraints. The methods presented here are broadly applicable to support strategic decisions that rely on the monitoring, enforcement, and compliance of environmental regulations.},

Although the term "adaptive governance" is not exclusively applied to the governance of social-ecological systems, related research represents a significant outgrowth of literature on resilience, social-ecological systems, and environmental governance. We present a chronology of major scholarship on adaptive governance, synthesizing efforts to define the concept and identifying the array of governance concepts associated with transformation toward adaptive governance. Based on this synthesis, we define adaptive governance as a range of interactions between actors, networks, organizations, and institutions emerging in pursuit of a desired state for social-ecological systems. In addition, we identify and discuss ambiguities in adaptive governance scholarship such as the roles of adaptive management, crisis, and a desired state for governance of social-ecological systems. Finally, we outline a research agenda to examine whether an adaptive governance approach can become institutionalized under current legal frameworks and political contexts. We suggest a further investigation of the relationship between adaptive governance and the principles of good governance; the roles of power and politics in the emergence of adaptive governance; and potential interventions such as legal reform that may catalyze or enhance governance adaptations or transformation toward adaptive governance.},

In this study, the basic trend and abrupt changes of precipitation at 63 meteorological stations and runoff as measured at six hydrological stations from 1956 to 2010 are analyzed. Results indicate that 38 stations exhibit negative precipitation trends. These stations are mainly located in the lower reaches. All six hydrological stations exhibit declining runoff trends. Abrupt runoff changes were mainly noted in the downstream portion of the basin. These variations then expanded to the middle and upper reaches. A precipitation-runoff double cumulative curve was used to detect the breakpoint of the precipitation-runoff relationship and to identify the impacts of human activities on runoff in the YR. Results show that the relatively uniform precipitation-runoff relationship has changed since 1993 in the upstream reaches and since 1970 in the middle and downstream reaches. Additionally, the relationship was more sensitive in the Lanzhou section. Human activities have become the dominant influencing factor on runoff variation since the 1970s. After the 1990s, the percentages of runoff variations due to human activities were 74.87\%, 82.2\%, 80.63\%, and 88.71\% at the Lanzhou, Toudaoguai, Huayuankou, and Lijin stations, respectively.},

  abstract = {Based on the long-term hydrological and meteorological series. DEM, soil database and documents of soil conservation measures of the middle Yellow River, investigations are made on the spatial and temporal changes of runoff and the impact of 11 factors, which include rainfall, temperature, terrain slope, drainage density, gravel, sand, silt, and organic carbon content in soil, water consumption, and soil conservation measures. The results show that the total runoff generated from the middle Yellow River had a decreasing trend in the past 60 years, with two abrupt falls around the years 1971 and 1991. In the spatial dimension, runoff modulus grew from the north to the south and from the west to the east, and the largest gradient of spatial change of runoff modulus happened during the period of 1956-1970 before the first falls of the total runoff. In the period 1954-2009. the average annual rate of temporal change of runoff modulus increased acceleratedly outward from the northwest of the middle Yellow River with a concentric ring pattern. Correlation analysis of runoff modulus with potential influencing factors in the spatial perspective reveals that the spatial distribution of the runoff modulus is principally the results of the regional variation of natural conditions. The results of the correlation analysis of the temporal series of runoff coefficient and influencing factors suggest that climate change, hydraulic engineering and soil conservation measures, were all the major causes of runoff reducing in the second half of the last century in the middle Yellow River. For the whole middle Yellow River, climate change contributed over 40\% of the runoff deviations in the 1960s, 1970s and 1990s. while water consumption induced also over 40\% runoff reduction in the 1960s. 1970s and 1980s. The runoff reduction due to hydraulic engineering was about 2-3 times of that caused by soil conservation measures, and both of them increased continuously from the 1960s to the 1980s, and kept at a higher level in the 1990s. The contribution of different causes to runoff deviation was variable in different drainage areas. Generally, in the semi-arid areas climate change played a decreasing role in runoff reduction comparing with other causes, while in the semi-humid areas it induced a higher and more variable proportion of runoff deviation according to the decade means.

  abstract = {Human activities over the last 100 years have fundamentally changed the biogeochemistry of the global nitrogen cycle. For example, increased nitrogen deposition from industrial and agricultural sources has been linked to lake acidification and nutrient fertilization, and thus it has the potential to significantly influence lake ecosystems. Records of anthropogenic nitrogen deposition from alpine lakes are sparse in China, which limits our understanding of its effects on remote alpine lake ecosystems. In this study, we analyzed multiple geochemical proxies at Tianchi Lake (2430 m a.s.l.), which is part of the Liupan Mountains National Nature Reserve in the central Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). We measured total nitrogen (TN) concentrations, C/N ratios and nitrogen stable isotope ratios (S15N), as well as a biological proxy (spectrally-inferred chlorophyll a), from a well-dated sediment core spanning the past 200 years. Our aim was to examine anthropogenic nitrogen deposition to the lake and to assess its implications for lake primary production. We found that 815N was stable prior to 1980, but it decreased significantly thereafter. This is consistent with documented changes in anthropogenic nitrogen deposition over the past 200 years, and it indicates that the 815N record of Tianchi Lake likely reflects anthropogenic nitrogen deposition, at least in this region. Prior to 1980, the trend in primary production of Tianchi Lake agrees with the trend of reconstructed regional temperature, when reactive nitrogen emissions in China were very low. This suggests that temperature was likely the 01_manuscript factor driving lake primary production before 1980. Primary production has increased significantly since 1980, consistent with the continued rising temperature and with enhanced nitrogen deposition, indicating that both factors are simultaneous drivers. Although the current data for Tianchi Lake are insufficient to unequivocally determine which of the two stressors is more important after the 1980s, temperature likely played the more significant role in driving primary production. This is because the lake is phosphorus-limited today, and in addition there is a strong association between temperature and chlorophyll a over the past 200 years. Continuing global warming and increasing nitrogen deposition in the future will likely further affect the fragile alpine ecosystems in the region.},

Human activities accounted for 60.14\% of the desertification reversal: annual average NDVI increased by 94\%, the severe desertification area decreased by 30\%, and the non-desertification area increased threefold. Vegeta\- tion restoration accounted for 70.96\% of the evapotranspiration increase of 5.17 mm{$\cdot$}yr\textendash 1. However, precipi\- tation could not support the increased water demand, which relied on replenishment from groundwater and Yellow River diversion. Therefore, to ensure water security in the Kubuqi, species that use less water should be used in future ecological restoration, and decision-makers should carefully consider the huge water consumption cost of ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {Reasonable allocation of ecological water and water economics has become a significant challenge for the water resource decision-makers. In this study we propose an approach to assess the quantity of reasonable distribution of the river ecological basic flow using the economic value of its own ecological function. Firstly, water resource is divided into two parts: (i) water resources used for the river ecological basic flow, its economic value was calculated using the results of a reference method; and (ii) water resources used for economic water use, and we calculated its economic benefit; (iii) By using the principle of benefit maximization, we determine the most reasonable distribution of the river ecological basic flow. The Baoji section of the Weihe River, the largest tributary of the Yellow River, Northeast China, is used as a case-study to calculate the reasonable distribution of the river ecological basic flow. The health status of the river and disadvantages of the calculation model are also analyzed. Results indicate that the reasonable allocation of the river ecological basic flow in the Baoji section of the Weihe River is 33.83\% of the amount of water resources in the Linjiacun hydrologic station. Based on the calculation of the different functions of the river ecological basic flow, the reasonable distribution can meet the basic environmental functions of rivers, and can result in healthy development of basin. Results also provide a quantitative basis for water resource management in relation to water distribution in the Weihe River.},

  abstract = {[1] The chemistry of major dissolved ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+ + K+, HCO3-, SO42-, Cl-) and dissolved silica (SiO2) in the river water of the Huanghe ( Yellow River), China, was studied from historical records at 100 stations in the drainage basin for the period 1958 - 2000 ( not all the parameters were continuously monitored during the entire period). This river system ( 750,000 km 2) presents an exceptional temporal and spatial water chemistry variability compared to other major rivers. The total dissolved solid ( TDS) concentration of the Huanghe varied over 2 to 3 orders of magnitude throughout the basin, with a median TDS concentration of 452 mg/L, which is about 4 times the world spatial median value (WSM). In particular, the concentrations of Na+ + K+, SO42-, and Cl- were 10 - 20 times higher than in other major world rivers. Similar to the Changjiang ( Yangtze River) and many other Himalayan rivers, the TDS at a given station is seasonally variable and inversely related to river runoff with a variation factor less than 2.0, despite a water dilution of fourfold to fivefold in the summer flood season. In addition to chemical weathering of sedimentary rocks, evaporation and fractional crystallization were found to be the major natural process controlling the major element chemistry of the Huanghe, owing to the abundance of loess and clastic rocks under arid and semiarid climates. A persistent increasing trend from year to year has been observed in the concentrations of TDS and all the salts except for HCO3- at all 01_manuscript-channel stations except for the uppermost Lanzhou. The rate of increase in the TDS concentration was the highest in the middle reaches (10.52 mg/L yr(-1) at Toudaoguai) and remained to be unusually high in the lower reaches (5.5 mg/L yr(-1) at Stations Luokou and Lijin). The increasing trend coincided with a significant decrease in water discharge at most of the 01_manuscript-channel stations in the past 40 years, and is attributed to increasing regulations of reservoirs and intensive water withdrawal for irrigation and diversions, as well as many other anthropogenic processes. Despite the increasing trend in TDS concentrations, the seaward TDS flux to the sea by the Huanghe has decreased dramatically from more than 20 x 10(9) kg/yr in the 1960s to less than 10 x 10(9) kg/yr at present, due to the sharp decrease in water discharge ( sometimes completely dried up) in the lower reaches of the river. The significant decreases in sea-ward fluxes of water and dissolved salts are expected to have profound physical, ecological, and socioeconomic impacts on the lower reaches of the river, the coastal areas and the Bohai Sea.},

Here the upstream, midstream and downstream of the Yellow River were selected as case study for well understanding the sustainability of water quality and quantity. The results showed the runoff of Yellow River has decreased since the 1950s due to human activities. Moreover, the water quality of the Yellow River is deteriorating with the rapid development of industry and urbanization. Especially heavy metals pollution, the concentrations of arsenic, cadmium, lead and total nitrogen increased gradually from upstream to downstream, while the concentrations of chromium, mercury, zinc and total phosphorous were highest in the midstream. The concentrations of nitrogen (e.g. ammonium and nitrate), volatile phenol and total amount of Escherichia coli displayed decreasing trends from upstream to downstream. In addition, the concentrations of heavy metals showed the highest value in the corresponding farmland of midstream except for Pb, which displayed the significant positive correlation with yellow river water, moreover As and Cr also showed the carcinogenic risk in irrigated farmland. Further analysis found the agriculture, industry and urban residential areas accounted for influence of 40\%, 26\%, and 16\% on water amount reduce, respectively. Industrial wastewater, domestic wastewater, phosphorus and nitrigen accounted for 66\%, 21\%, 8\% and 5\% of the influence on water quality, respectively. The results suggested that the sustainability of the water resource of the Yellow River is at risk in terms of quality and quantity. There is an urgent need to readjust the water allocation plan (namely 87 plan), establishing a water rights trading system, implement the precision irrigation on agricultural practices and adjust the industrial structure of the Yellow River Basin.},

In recent decades, under the combined human activities and influence of climate, the hydrologic regime of the upper Yellow River basin shows remarkable variations that have caused many issues. So potential human indicated influence has been drawing increasing attention from hydrologists and local governments. The aim of this study is to determine the changes in the hydrological characteristic parameters and mean annual runoff series of the upper Yellow River basin. This paper took the representative Lanzhou Station in the upstream Yellow River as an example, used the TFPW-MK mutation test and rank sum test to analyze the location of the variation points of hydrological series. By contrasting two different analysis results between natural and measured river runoff series, the impacts of human activities on the long-term hydrological regime were investigated. The variation range of hydrological ecological indexes before and after variation were analyzed by the method of indicators of hydrologic alteration (IHA). The results show: a) the hydrological series of Lanzhou Station is a significant decreasing trend can be observed in the natural stream flow series in 1985 with a high degree of hydrological variability, while human activities play an important role; b) various ecological indicators have changed in different degrees that have caused the deterioration of ecological conditions around 1985; and c) continuous decreasing stream flow in the upper Yellow River basin will trigger serious shortages of fresh water in the future, which may challenge the sustainability and safety of water resource development in the river basin, and should be paid great attention before 2020. Variation analysis and diagnosis of eco-hydrological indexes in the upper reaches of the Yellow River can provide a basis for the development, utilization, and protection of water resources in this area.},

LSLAs are playing an increasingly prominent role in this transition. Yet it remains unknown whether foreign LSLAs by agribusinesses target areas based on specific hydrological conditions and whether these investments compete with the water needs of existing local users. Here we combine process-based crop and hydrological modelling, agricultural statistics, and georeferenced information on individual transnational LSLAs to evaluate emergence of water scarcity associated with LSLAs. While conditions of blue water scarcity already existed prior to land acquisitions, these deals substantially exacerbate blue water scarcity through both the adoption of water-intensive crops and the expansion of irrigated cultivation. These effects lead to new rival water uses in 105 of the 160 studied LSLAs (67\% of the acquired land). Combined with our findings that investors target land with preferential access to surface and groundwater resources to support irrigation, this suggests that LSLAs often appropriate water resources to the detriment of local users.},

However, critics claim that actual implementation remains problematic, because of deep path dependencies and the entrenched interests.

The two rivers provide a natural experiment\textemdash similarity in physical scale, complexity, and integrated water resources management reforms, but highly different in social and policy contexts. Using the Q methodology and Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework, we find that, despite differences in policy contexts, narratives amongst the stakeholders in the two rivers are surprisingly similar, including a continued role for a negotiated local approach, and the presence of normative incentives for collective action, underwritten by deep historical meanings of the rivers. These narratives in turn provide some explanation for the choice of collective rules in use. They suggest that a modified form of integrated water resources management, taking into account narratives and collective choice rules, is useful for the governance of very large rivers across different contexts.},

A human interference index (HII) was established in our study based on the minimum and maximum influences of exploitation types, the different ecological conditions within the same exploitation type and the buffer effect of exploitation on adjacent areas. It was characterized by the comprehensive consideration of the ecological features and their spatial heterogeneity. To validate the accuracy and applicability of HII, the Yellow River Delta was selected as the study area, with the years of 1987, 1995, 2005 and 2016 as the temporal scope. Then, to clarify the ecological significance of HII, the relationships of landscape pattern, vegetation net primary productivity (NPP) and soil property with HII were analyzed. The HII of the study area exhibited a continuous increase and spatial heterogeneities from 1987 to 2016. The proportion of the little interference zone kept on decreasing, the proportions of the intermediate, severe and very severe interference zones continued increasing, and the proportion of the mild interference zone initially increased and then slightly decreased. Human interference spread continuously and has been the 01_manuscript driving factor of ecosystem change. The HII is significantly positively correlated with patch density, edge density, and soil salinity, and negatively correlated with NPP and soil moisture content. The HII was proven to possess high accuracy, good applicability and considerable ecological significance. Therefore, it can be widely used in the evaluation of human activity intensity in coastal areas.},

We utilize Cultural Theory and the British Social Attitudes survey ({$<$}em{$>$}N{$<$}/em{$>$} = 1,120) to study how three worldviews\textemdash egalitarianism, hierarchy, and individualism\textemdash relate to people's attitudes to sustainable mobility. First, we use factor analysis to extract the three worldviews or ways of life in Great Britain. Second, we construct hypotheses concerning the correlations between the worldviews and social attitudes to sustainable mobility. Our statistical analysis of 11 mobility issues in the survey confirms our hypotheses, elucidating the cultural cognition or rationality that underlies people's transport decision-making. Egalitarianism favors demand control, environmental friendliness, and action driven by inner conviction; hierarchy privileges conformity, order, and security; and individualism embraces freedom, speed, and external incentives. The findings show that the worldviews have a systematic and comprehensive impact on how people assess sustainable mobility debates. Moreover, we perform regression analysis to investigate how these cultural styles are associated with British people's sociodemographics and political party identification, which can help identify the characteristics of stakeholders in sustainability planning and engagement. We conclude that the worldviews form the bedrock of individual decisions on sustainable mobility and have a wider significance for holistic sustainability governance.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River shifted from the Diaokou course to the Qingshuigou course in 1976, and shifted again at the north bank of the Qingshuigou course in 1996. As a result, the entire modem Yellow River Delta has experienced complicated patterns of erosion and accretion. Multitemporal remote sensing data of Landsat MSS and TM from 1976 to 2000, totaling twenty scenes, were used to examine the changing pattern of accretion and erosion of the modem Yellow River subaerial delta with GIS tools. During the period 1976 to 2000, the maximum erosion occurred at the head of the last two abandoned promontories, Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories, where the coastline retreated landward over -7 and -4.5 km, respectively, with mean net erosion rates of -0.29 and -0.19 km/a, respectively. In contrast, the maximum accretion occurred at the head of the Qingshuigou Promontory where the coastline advanced seaward over 20 km with a mean net accretion rate of 0.83 km/a. The coastline at the head of the Q(8) Promontory also advanced seaward 7 km with a mean net accretion rate of 0.29 km/a during the period 1996 to 2000. Total area of the Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories was reduced by -141.3 km(2) with a mean net erosion rate of -6.03 km(2)/a. Total area of the Qingshuigou and Q(8) promontories increased by 384.16 and 11.88 km(2), respectively, with mean net accretion rates of 16.4 and 3.03 km(2)/a, respectively. Relative to the Diaokou, Shenxiangou and Qingshuigou promontories, the west area of the Diaokou Promontory and south area of the Qingshuigou Promontory were relatively stable, although minor erosion occurred. The general pattern of accretion and erosion of the modem Yellow River subaerial delta was divided into three stages: rapid accretion stage (1976-1984), accretion-erosion adjustment stage (1985-1995), and slow erosion stage (1996-present). The factors affecting the pattern of erosion and accretion over the Yellow River Delta, such as structural geology, the Yellow River sediment discharge, coastal processes, meteorological conditions, human activity, sea level rise and land subsidence were summarized. The cumulative area of increase over the entire subaerial delta is closely correlated with the cumulative Yellow River sediment discharge. Wave-induced longshore current is the major driving force to transport sediment from eroded areas along the last two abandoned promontories, Diaokou and Shenxiangou promontories, mostly westerly and partially easterly. Together with these coastal processes is the geographical shift of the Yellow River course associated with its discharge regime after 1976, leading to the accretion along the present Qingshuigou Promontory and then the Q(8) Promontory.

  abstract = {Hydrological regime is crucial in determining the carbon dioxide (CO2) exchange between the atmosphere and wetlands. Seasonal redistribution of precipitation is one featured hydrological regime shift, but its impacts on ecosystem CO2 exchange in coastal wetlands remain unclear. Here, based on the eddy-covariance technique, we examined how the net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) in a coastal wetland of Yellow River Delta in China differed between two years (2012 and 2013) with contrasting seasonal distribution of precipitation. The ecosystem absorbed more CO2 during the growing stage in 2013 (-268.5 g C m(-2)) than 2012 (-174.7 g C m(-2)). This difference resulted from higher NEE in the fast and middle growth stages with different reasons. In the fast growth stage, the higher mean daily NEE occurred due to more precipitation coupled with lower salt stress in 2013 (-6.3 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) compared to that in 2012 (-2.2 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)). During the middle growth stage, the mean daily NEE in 2013 (-4.2 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) was significantly higher than that in 2012 (-1.1 g CO2 m(-2) day(-1)) because the ecosystem in 2012 suffered more waterlogged stress. This dual effect of precipitation distribution on vegetation photosynthesis was also observed in a field manipulation experiment at the same site. Our results indicated that the redistribution of precipitation among seasons would play a critical role in regulating ecosystem CO2 exchange in the coastal wetland. More research on the associated changes between dynamics of soil hydrology and salinity could promote the accuracy of the carbon-budget estimates in coastal wetlands.},

Research results show that there has been a trend of changes in the LYR channel transverse profile parameters since the 1950s. The 01_manuscript river channel has a tendency of shrinkage year by year and the trend will be continued in the future. The 01_manuscript features of the LYR channel shrinkage are remarkable reductions of bankfull discharges and bankfull areas, corresponding decreases of bankfull widths, average bankfull water depths and maximal bankfull water depths, as well as increases of bankfull water levels and width-depth ratios accompanied. The discriminant parameters for threshold of the LYR 01_manuscript channel shrinkage were put forward. It indicates that the LYR 01_manuscript channel began to shrink in the 1970s and has entered into a serious phase of channel shrinkage since the 1990s. The incompatible index of discharged water-sediment processes of the Sanmenxia Reservoir was introduced, which revealed that there was a trend of increasing in the incompatibility between water flow and sediment load. Response relations between the LYR 01_manuscript channel shrinkage parameters and discharged water-sediment processes of the Sanmenxia Reservoir were founded, which indicate that the LYR 01_manuscript channel shrinkage can be mitigated and improved through the regulation of discharged water-sediment processes of the reservoir, especially through the regulation of water-sediment incompatible index. The LYR channel for water and sediment transportation can be restored and maintained.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to water and sanitation mandate the implementation of collaborative approaches to water governance to secure water for all by 2030. The implementation of collaborative governance requires the adoption of supportive regulations, resources, and the development of capable public sector institutions. In recent years, several countries in Latin America have introduced reforms to their water codes to promote collaborative water governance. However, our knowledge of the outcomes of these reforms is still in its infancy, in particular on how they influence the evolution of existing governance initiatives. In this paper, I study how collaborative water governance initiatives in Ecuador responded to the introduction of new regulations for stakeholder participation in watershed councils. Our findings show that network structures respond in different ways to policy change. In a context where regulations limit the participation of NGOs in watershed committees, the network with higher dependency to external resources was incapable of adjusting. On the other hand, the key 01_manuscript that helped the resilient network navigate policy change were the existence of high levels of trust, the availability of resources to subsidize participation, the ability to connect the local structure to other networks, and high levels of perceived legitimacy. Governments and international donors interested in SDG 6 should consider these 01_manuscript to design and implement strategies to promote collaborative management in regions where initiatives already exist. Failure to do so may cause weaker structures to disappear, and discourage actors from future participation, increasing the costs of putting collaborative structures in place and leaving inequalities untackled.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We consider two different types of socio-hydrological systems: green systems, whereby societies deal with risk only via non-structural measures, and technological systems, whereby risk is dealt with also by structural measures, such as levees. A stylized model of human-flood interactions is first compared to real-world data collected at two test sites (People's Republic of Bangladesh and the city of Rome, Italy) and then used to explore plausible trajectories of flood risk. The results show that flood risk in technological systems tends to be significantly lower than in green systems. However, technological systems may undergo catastrophic events, which lead to much higher losses. Furthermore, green systems prove to be more resilient than technological ones, which makes them more capable of withstanding environmental and social changes.},

Research has identified six capacities necessary to support such interventions in guiding development pathways toward sustainability. These are capacities to (a) measure sustainable development, (b) promote equity, (c) adapt to shocks and surprises, (d ) transform the system into more sustainable development pathways, (e) link knowledge with action, and ( f ) devise governance arrangements that allow people to work together in exercising the other capacities.},

The drawdown of the water table ranges from 18.1 to 113.2 cm and 10.4 to 101.9 cm for a bare soil and a perennial grass scenario and is highly related to the annual rainfall of the previous rainy season. The results indicate that the mean daily FAO-PM reference evapotranspiration rates for this area ranged from 2 to 4 mmd\textsuperscript{-1} and that the estimated actual evapotranspiration (ET\textsubscript{a}) from the HYDRUS 1D model ranged between 0.22 to 1.11and 0.23 to 1.27 mmd\textsuperscript{-1} in bare soil and vegetative condition, respectively. ET\textsubscript{a} and ET\textsubscript{G} were well correlated for the vegetated scenario. However, the WTF method slightly overestimates ET\textsubscript{a} fluxes in the bare soil scenario. The study shows that the decline of ET\textsubscript{a} with water table depth can be simulated by an exponential function. The overall results indicate that higher ET\textsubscript{a} values were observed when the water table is shallow, suggesting that ET\textsubscript{a} is mainly driven by the water table depth at this site.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this book Daniel Connell explains why there is a crisis in the Murray Darling. He highlights the disastrous consequences of a century of fitful, reluctant "co-operation" between the six governments responsible for the region. Connell argues that a new institutional system is essential - but a Commonwealth takeover is not the best answer. Instead, the Commonwealth government should use its constitutional and financial power to force the States to adopt national policies - and stick to them, whatever the local politics. The States would continue to play a substantial role but the controls would be tighter, the framework more comprehensive. He also shows how the National Water Initiative, the great blueprint for water reform, has stalled with many of its most important recommendations ignored. So far the public debate about the future of the Murray Darling Basin has concentrated on new technical projects and increased water trading. Connell argues that unless institutional change is given priority, hundreds of millions of dollars of annual investment will be frittered away - and the crisis will continue.},

Here we analyse empirical data from terrestrial (               n               \,=\,4), marine (               n               \,=\,25) and freshwater (               n               \,=\,13) environments and show positive sub-linear empirical relationships between the size and shift duration of systems. Each additional unit area of an ecosystem provides an increasingly smaller unit of time taken for that system to collapse, meaning that large systems tend to shift more slowly than small systems but disproportionately faster. We substantiate these findings with five computational models that reveal the importance of system structure in controlling shift duration. The findings imply that shifts in Earth ecosystems occur over `human' timescales of years and decades, meaning the collapse of large vulnerable ecosystems, such as the Amazon rainforest and Caribbean coral reefs, may take only a few decades once triggered.},

We used the Mann-Kendall trend test and linear regression to determine trends and abrupt changes of runoff and sediment load during the period between 1950 and 2005, based on monthly hydrological data. Results show that runoff and sediment load decreased from 1950 to 2005, on annual or monthly time scales. Their changes are divided into three stages: fluctuating stage (1950-1970), slowly decreasing stage (1970-1980) and accelerated decreasing stage (1980-2005). The relationship between runoff and sediment load was most significant, and it can be expressed as a linear regression function. Precipitation was one of the most important climate factors affecting runoff before 1985, and the impact of human activities on runoff decrease grew strongly after 1985. Water balance analysis of the Yellow River basin indicates that natural climate change contributed about 55.3\% and human activities about 44.7\% to the runoff decrease after 1986.},

This study extracted mean high tide lines of the Yellow River estuary from MSS, TM and ETM+ data from 1976 to 2005, and explored relationships between the accretion-erosion of land and the runoff and sediment load of the Yellow River. The results showed that the general pattern of accretion-erosion of the entire estuary was divided into four stages: rapid accretion stage (1976-1986), accretion-erosion adjustment stage (1986-1996), slow erosion stage (1996-2003), and slow accretion stage (2003-present). For maintaining the annual balance of the entire estuary (1976-2005) and Q8 estuary (most recent course of the Qingshuigou estuary from 1996 to 2005), critical annual runoff and sediment load are 140.36 x 10(8) m(3) year(-1) and 3.31 x 10(8) t year(-1), and 85.0 x 10(8) m(3) year(-1) and 1.63 x 10(8) t year(-1),respectively. In the future decades, the Q8 estuary is likely to maintain its shape and area balance or have a little accretion, but the entire estuary could be in an eroding state.

Improving understanding of how hydrological connectivity varies with respect to surface-water dynamics is an important step to maintain biodiversity in dynamic coastal environments. Using a series of available remote sensing images, we extracted surface-water patches across a 12-year (2006-2017) and assessed the corresponding hydrological connectivity using the landscape connectivity metrics. Furthermore, we identified important surface-water patches serve as connectivity providers in surface-water networks. Particularly, the threshold distance, needed for analysis of hydrological connectivity, was determined by "Distance- Landscape Connectivity Metrics" curves. We focused on China's Yellow River Delta (YRD), a globally significant floodplain and coastal wetland. Results showed that hydrological connectivity, fluctuating in a range of 0.0726 to 0.0908 during 2006-2017, varied with the number and spatial distribution of water patches. Our study highlight that water patches in Dawenliu Restoration (DR) could serve as ideal high-priority targets for specific management aimed at maintaining or improving hydrological connectivity. We also found that the suitable threshold distance for analyzing hydrological connectivity of the Yellow River Delta National Natural Reserve (YRDNR) is 500 m.

We used national-level data and a mathematical model to provide an empirical test of the hypothesis that national economies display two distinct economic regimes that are maintained by self-reinforcing feedbacks between natural resources and society. Our results not only support previous findings that two distinct groups exist, but also show that countries move toward one of these two different equilibrium points because of their different patterns of natural resource use and responses to population growth. At the less economically developed equilibrium point maintained by ``green-loop'' feedbacks, human populations depend more directly on ecosystems for income. At the more economically developed equilibrium point maintained by ``red-loop'' feedbacks, nonecosystem services (e.g., technology, manufacturing, services) generate the majority of national gross domestic product (GDP), but increasing consumption of natural resources means that environmental impacts are higher and are often exported (via cross-scale feedbacks) to other countries. Feedbacks between income and population growth are pushing countries farther from sustainability. Our analysis shows that economic growth alone cannot lead to environmental sustainability and that current trajectories of resource use cannot be sustained without breaking feedback loops in national and international economies.},

Permission extents were bimodal; 72\% were fine scale (median 16.5 km2), and 28\% were broad scale (median 99,193 km2). Biophysical data were unimodal and at significantly smaller scales than permissions. Different permission scales for different activities indicated adaptability within the permitting system. Our analysis demonstrates a new approach to quantifying scale mismatches. It suggests that discrete institutional scales exist but differ from ecological scales and that rules at broader scales than the managed resource may allow greater adaptation and responsiveness by human users than rules at the same scales.},

  abstract = {Scale is a concept that transcends disciplinary boundaries. In ecology and geography, scale is usually defined in terms of spatial and temporal dimensions. Sociological scale also incorporates space and time, but adds ideas about representation and organization. Although spatial and temporal location determine the context for social and ecological dynamics, social-ecological interactions can create dynamic feedback loops in which humans both influence and are influenced by ecosystem processes. We hypothesize that many of the problems encountered by societies in managing natural resources arise because of a mismatch between the scale of management and the scale(s) of the ecological processes being managed. We use examples from southern Africa and the southern United States to address four 01_manuscript questions: ( 1) What is a "scale mismatch?" ( 2) How are scale mismatches generated? ( 3) What are the consequences of scale mismatches? ( 4) How can scale mismatches be resolved? Scale mismatches occur when the scale of environmental variation and the scale of social organization in which the responsibility for management resides are aligned in such a way that one or more functions of the social-ecological system are disrupted, inefficiencies occur, and/or important components of the system are lost. They are generated by a wide range of social, ecological, and linked social-ecological processes. Mismatches between the scales of ecological processes and the institutions that are responsible for managing them can contribute to a decrease in social-ecological resilience, including the mismanagement of natural resources and a decrease in human well-being. Solutions to scale mismatches usually require institutional changes at more than one hierarchical level. Long-term solutions to scale mismatch problems will depend on social learning and the development of flexible institutions that can adjust and reorganize in response to changes in ecosystems. Further research is needed to improve our ability to diagnose, understand, and resolve scale mismatches in linked social-ecological systems.},

  abstract = {China's economic growth is expected to continue into the next decades, accompanied by sustained urbanization and industrialization. The associated increase in demand for land, water resources, and rich foods will deepen the challenge of sustainably feeding the population and balancing agricultural and environmental policies. We combine a hydrologic model with an economic model to project China's future food trade patterns and embedded water resources by 2030 and to analyze the effects of targeted irrigation reductions on this system, notably on national agricultural water consumption and food self-sufficiency. We simulate interprovincial and international food trade with a general equilibrium welfare model and a linear programming optimization, and we obtain province-level estimates of commodities' virtual water content with a hydrologic model. We find that reducing irrigated land in regions highly dependent on scarce river flow and nonrenewable groundwater resources, such as Inner Mongolia and the greater Beijing area, can improve the efficiency of agriculture and trade regarding water resources. It can also avoid significant consumption of irrigation water across China (up to 14.8 km               3               /y, reduction by 14\%), while incurring relatively small decreases in national food self-sufficiency (e.g., by 3\% for wheat). Other researchers found that a national, rather than local, water policy would have similar effects on food production but would only reduce irrigation water consumption by 5\%.},

A critical challenge is to test whether specific biomes, taxa or types of species benefit or suffer in a time of accelerating global change. We analysed nearly 10,000 abundance time series from over 2000 vertebrate species part of the Living Planet Database. We integrated abundance data with information on geographic range, habitat preference, taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships, and IUCN Red List Categories and threats. We find that 15\% of populations declined, 18\% increased, and 67\% showed no net changes over time. Against a backdrop of no biogeographic and phylogenetic patterning in population change, we uncover a distinct taxonomic signal. Amphibians were the only taxa that experienced net declines in the analysed data, while birds, mammals and reptiles experienced net increases. Population trends were poorly captured by species' rarity and global-scale threats. Incorporation of the full spectrum of population change will improve conservation efforts to protect global biodiversity.},

The grasslands are part of the Eurasian grasslands, one of the world's largest land-based ecosystems, extending from eastern China and eastern Europe. After centuries of grazing, much of the Chinese grasslands are considered degraded, with considerable off-site impacts such as soil erosion affecting air and water quality. Since 2001, research institutions in China have worked with international scientists and grassland experts to support the restoration of degraded grasslands through better management, while improving the income of herder households. Australian scientists were involved through several ACIAR-supported projects. The understanding of Chinese grassland systems significantly improved and better guidelines for managing grasslands to achieve a sustainable and resilient state were developed, to the point where herders see a future in livestock production on grasslands. This monograph presents the current state of knowledge for managing these vast grasslands and what has been learned in the new century. The results reported in this book apply not only to the grasslands in China but also to those in Mongolia, Russia and throughout Central Asia, and the principles elicited here are also relevant to grasslands in many other developing countries.},

Under the ESA, it is illegal to kill an endangered species and it is also illegal to damage its habitat. By preventing the establishment of an old-growth pine stand, landowners can ensure that RCWs do not inhabit their land and avoid ESA regulations that limit or prohibit timber harvest activity. Data from 1984\textendash 90 on over 1,000 individual forest plots are used to test predictions about the probability of harvest and the age of timber when it is harvested. We find that increases in the proximity of a plot to RCWs increases the probability that the plot will be harvested and decreases the age at which the forest is harvested.},

  abstract = {Groundwater is the world's largest accessible source of freshwater to satisfy human water needs. Moreover, groundwater buffers variable precipitation rates over time, thereby effectively sustaining river flows in times of droughts and evaporation in areas with shallow water tables. In this study, building on previous work, we simulate groundwater head fluctuations and groundwater storage changes in both confined and unconfined aquifer systems using a global-scale high-resolution (5 ) groundwater model by deriving new estimates of the distribution and thickness of confining layers. Inclusion of confined aquifer systems (estimated 6\textendash 20\% of the total aquifer area) improves estimates of timing and amplitude of groundwater head fluctuations and changes groundwater flow paths and groundwater-surface water interaction rates. Groundwater flow paths within confining layers are shorter than paths in the underlying aquifer, while flows within the confined aquifer can get disconnected from the local drainage system due to the low conductivity of the confining layer. Lateral groundwater flows between basins are significant in the model, especially for areas with (partially) confined aquifers were long flow paths crossing catchment boundaries are simulated, thereby supporting water budgets of neighboring catchments or aquifer systems. The developed two-layer transient groundwater model is used to identify hot-spots of groundwater depletion. Global groundwater depletion is estimated as 7013 km3 (137 km3y-1) over 1960\textendash 2010, which is consistent with estimates of previous studies.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Precipitation data collected at sub-hourly resolution represents specific challenges for missing data recovery by being largely stochastic in nature and highly unbalanced in the duration of rain vs non-rain. Here we present a two-step analysis utilising current machine learning techniques for imputing precipitation data sampled at 30-minute intervals by devolving the task into (a) the classification of rain or non-rain samples, and (b) regressing the absolute values of predicted rain samples. Investigating 37 weather stations in the UK, this machine learning process produces more accurate predictions for recovering precipitation data than an established surface fitting technique utilising neighbouring rain gauges. Increasing available features for the training of machine learning algorithms increases performance with the integration of weather data at the target site with externally sourced rain gauges providing the highest performance. This method informs machine learning models by utilising information in concurrently collected environmental data to make accurate predictions of missing rain data. Capturing complex non-linear relationships from weakly correlated variables is critical for data recovery at sub-hourly resolutions. Such pipelines for data recovery can be developed and deployed for highly automated and near instantaneous imputation of missing values in ongoing datasets at high temporal resolutions.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Resilience is an overarching concept concerning the capacity of complex systems to react to severe crisis by selforganization, innovation and learning and to attain more robust settings than in the original condition. While the theory on resilience has exploded in the last decades, its operationalization is less practiced. A possible way out is the selection of appropriate variables able to measure the behaviour of a system, when it is subject to important stresses. Resilience has been applied to the study of socio-ecological systems, including ecological networks. Ecological networks can reconnect fragmented landscapes through a web of patches intertwined by environmental corridors. In this paper, we aim at assessing the resilience of two ecological networks designed for the towns of Nuoro and Sassari, Italy. The ecological networks are built on the ecological properties of two vegetal target species (i.e. Quercus ilex and Olea europaea) and their seed dispersal through the corresponding frugivorous animal vector species. We have studied the behaviour of the ecological networks under different types of attacks to the patches: at random or according to a deterministic choice. Our method allows to compare the dynamic pattern of resilience (i.e. along the process of elimination of patches) and to observe typical behaviour reported in other cases but also interesting peculiarities.},

  abstract = {The time is now For decades, scientists have been raising calls for societal changes that will reduce our impacts on nature. Though much conservation has occurred, our natural environment continues to decline under the weight of our consumption. Humanity depends directly on the output of nature; thus, this decline will affect us, just as it does the other species with which we share this world. D\'iaz et al. review the findings of the largest assessment of the state of nature conducted as of yet. They report that the state of nature, and the state of the equitable distribution of nature's support, is in serious decline. Only immediate transformation of global business-as-usual economies and operations will sustain nature as we know it, and us, into the future. Science, this issue p. eaax3100 Structured Abstract BACKGROUNDHuman actions have long been known to drive declines in nature, and there is growing awareness of how globalization means that these drivers increasingly act at a distance (telecoupling). However, evidence from different disciplines has largely accumulated in parallel, and the global effects of telecouplings have never been addressed comprehensively. Now, the first integrated global-scale intergovernmental assessment of the status, trends, and future of the links between people and nature provides an unprecedented picture of the extent of our mutual dependence, the breadth and depth of the ongoing and impending crisis, and the interconnectedness among sectors and regions. ADVANCESHuman impacts on life on Earth have increased sharply since the 1970s. The world is increasingly managed to maximize the flow of material contributions from nature to keep up with rising demands for food, energy, timber, and more, with global trade increasing the geographic separation between supply and demand. This unparalleled appropriation of nature is causing the fabric of life on which humanity depends to fray and unravel: Most indicators of the state of nature, whether monitored by natural and social scientists or by Indigenous Peoples and local communities, are declining. These include the number and population size of wild species, the number of local varieties of domesticated species, the distinctness of ecological communities, and the extent and integrity of many terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. As a consequence, nature's capacity to provide crucial benefits has also declined, including environmental processes underpinning human health and nonmaterial contributions to human quality of life. The costs are distributed unequally, as are the benefits of an expanding global economy.These trends in nature and its contributions to people are projected to worsen in the coming decades\textemdash unevenly so among different regions\textemdash unless rapid and integrated action is taken to reduce the direct drivers responsible for most change over the past 50 years: land and sea use change, direct harvesting of many plants and animals, climate change (whose impacts are set to accelerate), pollution, and the spread of invasive alien species. Exploratory scenarios suggest that a world with increased regional barriers\textemdash resonating with recent geopolitical trends\textemdash will yield more negative global trends in nature, as well as the greatest disparity in trends across regions, greater than a world with liberal financial markets, and much greater than one that prioritizes and integrates actions toward sustainable development. Evidence from target-seeking scenarios and pathways indicates that a world that achieves many of the global biodiversity targets and sustainability goals related to food, energy, climate, and water is not\textemdash yet\textemdash beyond reach, but that no single action can get us there. OUTLOOKOur comprehensive assessment of status, trends, and possible futures for nature and people suggests that action at the level of direct drivers of nature decline, although necessary, is not sufficient to prevent further deterioration of the fabric of life on Earth. Reversal of recent declines\textemdash and a sustainable global future\textemdash are only possible with urgent transformative change that tackles the root causes: the interconnected economic, sociocultural, demographic, political, institutional, and technological indirect drivers behind the direct drivers. As well as a pan-sectoral approach to conserving and restoring the nature that underpins many goals, this transformation will need innovative governance approaches that are adaptive; inclusive; informed by existing and new evidence; and integrative across systems, jurisdictions, and tools. Although the challenge is formidable, every delay will make the task even harder. Crucially, our analysis pinpoints five priority interventions (``levers'') and eight leverage points for intervention in the indirect drivers of global social and economic systems where they can make the biggest difference. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/366/6471/eaax3100/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Traditional diversity-rich human landscapes, and the livelihoods and identities that depend on them, face global threats.Mosaics of crops, forest, and pasture have been maintained for millennia around the world.

So are the livelihoods and cultural identity of the peoples that live in them, such as this woman collecting fodder for her flock in the Checacupe district, Per\'u.Photo credit www.estebantapella.com The human impact on life on Earth has increased sharply since the 1970s, driven by the demands of a growing population with rising average per capita income. Nature is currently supplying more materials than ever before, but this has come at the high cost of unprecedented global declines in the extent and integrity of ecosystems, distinctness of local ecological communities, abundance and number of wild species, and the number of local domesticated varieties. Such changes reduce vital benefits that people receive from nature and threaten the quality of life of future generations. Both the benefits of an expanding economy and the costs of reducing nature's benefits are unequally distributed. The fabric of life on which we all depend\textemdash nature and its contributions to people\textemdash is unravelling rapidly. Despite the severity of the threats and lack of enough progress in tackling them to date, opportunities exist to change future trajectories through transformative action. Such action must begin immediately, however, and address the root economic, social, and technological causes of nature's deterioration.},

  abstract = {In flood risk assessment, there remains a lack of analytical frameworks capturing the dynamics emerging from two-way feedbacks between physical and social processes, such as adaptation and levee effect. The former, adaptation effect, relates to the observation that the occurrence of more frequent flooding is often associated with decreasing vulnerability. The latter, levee effect, relates to the observation that the non-occurrence of frequent flooding (possibly caused by flood protection structures, e.g. levees) is often associated to increasing vulnerability. As current analytical frameworks do not capture these dynamics, projections of future flood risk are not realistic. In this paper, we develop a new approach whereby the mutual interactions and continuous feedbacks between floods and societies are explicitly accounted for. Moreover, we show an application of this approach by using a socio-hydrological model to simulate the behavior of two 01_manuscript prototypes of societies: green societies, which cope with flooding by resettling out of flood-prone areas; and technological societies, which deal with flooding also by building levees or dikes. This application shows that the proposed approach is able to capture and explain the aforementioned dynamics (i.e. adaptation and levee effect) and therefore contribute to a better understanding of changes in flood risk, within an iterative process of theory development and empirical research.},

  abstract = {Over history, humankind has tended to settle near streams because of the role of rivers as transportation corridors and the fertility of riparian areas. However, human settlements in floodplains have been threatened by the risk of flooding. Possible responses have been to resettle away and/or modify the river system by building flood control structures. This has led to a complex web of interactions and feedback mechanisms between hydrological and social processes in settled floodplains. This paper is an attempt to conceptualise these interplays for hypothetical human-flood systems. We develop a simple, dynamic model to represent the interactions and feedback loops between hydrological and social processes. The model is then used to explore the dynamics of the human-flood system and the effect of changing individual characteristics, including external forcing such as technological development. The results show that the conceptual model is able to reproduce reciprocal effects between floods and people as well as the emergence of typical patterns. For instance, when levees are built or raised to protect floodplain areas, their presence not only reduces the frequency of flooding, but also exacerbates high water levels. Then, because of this exacerbation, higher flood protection levels are required by society. As a result, more and more flooding events are avoided, but rare and catastrophic events take place.},

  abstract = {The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations Agenda 2030 represent an ambitious blueprint to reduce inequalities globally and achieve a sustainable future for all mankind. Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society. To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario-based approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural, technical, and social dimensions of human-water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scientific challenges to strengthen the field and broaden its scope. These include engagement with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time. Plain Language Summary Water crises that humanity faces are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity. As such, they require a more integrated approach in managing water resources, which involves all actors and stakeholders and considers how water resources link different sectors of society. Yet, water management practice is still dominated by technocratic approaches, which emphasize technical solutions. While these approaches may work in the short-term, they often result in unintended consequences in the long-term. Sociohydrology is developing a generalizable understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between natural,technical and social processes, which can improve water management practice. As such, advancing sociohydrology can contribute to address the global water crises and meet the water-related targets defined by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.},

We argue that there are two counterintuitive dynamics that should be considered in this debate: supply\textendash demand cycles and reservoir effects. Supply\textendash demand cycles describe instances where increasing water supply enables higher water demand, which can quickly offset the initial benefits of reservoirs. Reservoir effects refer to cases where over-reliance on reservoirs increases vulnerability, and therefore increases the potential damage caused by droughts. Here we illustrate these counterintuitive dynamics with global and local examples, and discuss policy and research implications.},

I hypothesise that the geographic environment of neighbouring ethnic groups determines their potential gains from trade, and that the frequency of inter-ethnic trade\textemdash and resulting social interactions\textemdash shape the co-evolution of language. As a test of this hypothesis, I build a georeferenced dataset to examine the border region of spatially adjacent ethnic groups, together with variation in the set of potentially cultivatable crops at the onset of the Columbian Exchange, to identify how variation in land productivity impacts linguistic differences between adjacent ethnic groups. I find that ethnic groups separated across geographic regions with high variation in land productivity are more similar in language than groups separated across more homogeneous regions. I develop a model to theoretically ground this link between land productivity variation and inter-ethnic trade, and provide empirical evidence in support of this mechanism, including direct evidence of a causal link between land productivity variation and an ethnic group's reliance on trade for food and subsistence in pre-modern times.},

  abstract = {Climate scientists have long emphasized the importance of climate tipping points like thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, and changes in atmospheric circulation. Yet, save for a few fragmented studies, climate economics has either ignored them or represented them in highly stylized ways. We provide unified estimates of the economic impacts of all eight climate tipping points covered in the economic literature so far using a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a modular structure. The model includes national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels for 180 countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling. Collectively, climate tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by {$\sim$}25\% in our 01_manuscript specification. The distribution is positively skewed, however. We estimate an {$\sim$}10\% chance of climate tipping points more than doubling the SCC. Accordingly, climate tipping points increase global economic risk. A spatial analysis shows that they increase economic losses almost everywhere. The tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation of ocean methane hydrates and thawing permafrost. Most of our numbers are probable underestimates, given that some tipping points, tipping point interactions, and impact channels have not been covered in the literature so far; however, our method of structural meta-analysis means that future modeling of climate tipping points can be integrated with relative ease, and we present a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could be incorporated in other IAMs.},

While short-term impacts are dominated by direct effects arising from reduced human activity, longer-lasting impacts are likely to result from cascading effects of the economic recession on global poverty, green investment and human behaviour. These impacts offer the opportunity for novel insight, particularly with the careful deployment of targeted data collection, coordinated model experiments and solution-oriented randomized controlled trials, during and after the pandemic.},

This paper is the first known attempt to quantify the volume of MAR at global scale, and to illustrate the advancement of all the major types of MAR and relate these to research and regulatory advancements. Faced with changing climate and rising intensity of climate extremes, MAR is an increasingly important water management strategy, alongside demand management, to maintain, enhance and secure stressed groundwater systems and to protect and improve water quality. During this time, scientific research\textemdash on hydraulic design of facilities, tracer studies, managing clogging, recovery efficiency and water quality changes in aquifers\textemdash has underpinned practical improvements in MAR and has had broader benefits in hydrogeology. Recharge wells have greatly accelerated recharge, particularly in urban areas and for mine water management. In recent years, research into governance, operating practices, reliability, economics, risk assessment and public acceptance of MAR has been undertaken. Since the 1960s, implementation of MAR has accelerated at a rate of 5\%/year, but is not keeping pace with increasing groundwater extraction. Currently, MAR has reached an estimated 10 km3/year, \textasciitilde 2.4\% of groundwater extraction in countries reporting MAR (or \textasciitilde 1.0\% of global groundwater extraction). MAR is likely to exceed 10\% of global extraction, based on experience where MAR is more advanced, to sustain quantity, reliability and quality of water supplies.},

  abstract = {The ecological restoration of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) requires urgent scientific and rational quantification of comprehensive value of water resources to optimally allocate water resources. Considering the sustainability of ecological environment, the quantifications of sediment transport value and negative sewage value were introduced into the calculation of comprehensive value of water resources in this study. First, Reynolds time-averaged turbulence equations, force analysis and fluid mechanics were adopted in succession to precisely calculate the work on the bedload sediment and the suspended load sediment. Next, the quantification of the value of sediment transport in each river interval was presented based on the emergy theory. Furthermore, to coordinate and optimize the ecological environmental, economic, and social values, a dynamic differential game-based multi-objective optimal water allocation model of the basin was proposed. On this basis, the Lagrangian multiplier method and the Hamiltonian function were exploited to obtain the optimal trading quantity of water in each province and bargain price. The provinces in the YRB were selected as a case study to verify the feasibility and practicality of the proposed model. Results indicate that (1) compared with previous optimal water allocation schemes, the economic value, social value, ecological environmental value, sediment transport value and negative sewage value of the YRB in this study in 2019 are \textyen 2.57\ding{53}1011, \textyen 3.27\ding{53}1011, \textyen 2.74\ding{53}1011, \textyen 6.27\ding{53}1010, and \textyen 3.30\ding{53}1010, respectively, which is more balanced and sustainable in each field; (2) this model significantly increases the ecological environmental value (EEV) of YRB in 2019 from \textyen 2.21\ding{53}1011 to \textyen 2.74\ding{53}1011\textemdash which takes into consideration the sediment transport value (STV) and negative sewage value, and thus the method in this study pays more attention to water ecological sustainability; (3) the model significantly improved the comprehensive value of water resources in the YRB to \textyen 785.2169\ding{53}108 if T=1~month and \textyen 4471.0611\ding{53}108 if T=0.5~year in 2019. Therefore, instead of pursuing economic value unilaterally, this study can coordinate and optimize the ecological environmental, economic, and social values (SV) to improve the strategic trade-offs in efforts towards basin water sustainability.},

Availability of the raw resources is essential, but equally important are the services that deliver resources to human populations, such as adequate access to safe drinking water, electricity, and sufficient food. Any failures in either resource availability or FEW resources-related services will have an impact on human health. The ability of countries to intervene and overcome the challenges in the FEW domain depends on governance, education, and economic capacities. We distinguish between FEW resources, FEW services, and FEW health outcomes to develop an analysis framework for evaluating interrelationships among these critical resources. The framework is applied using a data-driven approach for sub-Saharan African countries, a region with notable FEW insecurity challenges. The data-driven approach using a cross-validated stepwise regression analysis indicates that limited governance and socioeconomic capacity in sub-Saharan African countries, rather than lack of the primary resources, more significantly impact access to FEW services and associated health outcomes. The proposed framework helps develop a cohesive approach for evaluating FEW metrics and could be applied to other regions of the world to continue improving our understanding of the FEW nexus.},

Beyond geophysical stressors and responses, it is critical to also consider how multi-sector, multi-scale economic teleconnections mitigate or exacerbate water shortages. Here, we contribute a global-to-basin-scale exploratory analysis of potential water scarcity impacts by linking a global human-Earth system model, a global hydrologic model, and a metric for the loss of economic surplus due to resource shortages. We find that, dependent on scenario assumptions, major hydrologic basins can experience strongly positive or strongly negative economic impacts due to global trade dynamics and market adaptations to regional scarcity. In many cases, market adaptation profoundly magnifies economic uncertainty relative to hydrologic uncertainty. Our analysis finds that impactful scenarios are often combinations of standard scenarios, showcasing that planners cannot presume drivers of uncertainty in complex adaptive systems.},

  abstract = {Analysis of Earth system dynamics in the Anthropocene requires explicitly taking into account the increasing magnitude of processes operating in human societies, their cultures, economies and technosphere and their growing feedback entanglement with those in the physical, chemical and biological systems of the planet. However, current state-of-the-art Earth system models do not represent dynamic human societies and their feedback interactions with the biogeophysical Earth system and macroeconomic integrated assessment models typically do so only with limited scope. This paper (i) proposes design principles for constructing world\textendash Earth models (WEMs) for Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene, i.e., models of social (world)\textendash ecological (Earth) coevolution on up to planetary scales, and (ii) presents the copan:CORE open simulation modeling framework for developing, composing and analyzing such WEMs based on the proposed principles. The framework provides a modular structure to flexibly construct and study WEMs. These can contain biophysical (e.g., carbon cycle dynamics), socio-metabolic or economic (e.g., economic growth or energy system changes), and sociocultural processes (e.g., voting on climate policies or changing social norms) and their feedback interactions, and they are based on elementary entity types, e.g., grid cells and social systems. Thereby, copan:CORE enables the epistemic flexibility needed for contributions towards Earth system analysis of the Anthropocene given the large diversity of competing theories and methodologies used for describing socio-metabolic or economic and sociocultural processes in the Earth system by various fields and schools of thought. To illustrate the capabilities of the framework, we present an exemplary and highly stylized WEM implemented in copan:CORE that illustrates how endogenizing sociocultural processes and feedbacks such as voting on climate policies based on socially learned environmental awareness could fundamentally change macroscopic model outcomes.},

The precise estimation of soil water storage in diverse soil layers is fundamental to understanding hydro-biological processes and efficiently managing water resources. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of topography (elevation) and soil properties (clay, silt, sand content, median grain size, and fractal dimension) on soil water storage and then to estimate soil water storage using a state-space approach. The soil water storage values of three soil layers (0-1, 1-2, and 2-3 m) were measured from May to December 2014 at 70 locations along two 187 m long transects on a hillslope of the Loess Plateau, China. Samples from various depths were also collected to determine soil properties. The best state-space approach explained 98.8\% of the total variation in soil water storage, while the best classical linear regression equation only explained 64.2\%. The state-space approach using any combination of variables described the spatial pattern of soil water storage much better than equivalent linear regression equations. Elevation and clay content were identified as the most effective combination for soil water storage estimation in the state-space approach, and were used to effectively predict the soil water storage spatial pattern along the second transect The state-space approach is thus a useful tool that is recommended for predicting soil water storage spatial patterns at the hillslope scale using topography and soil properties.

Recently, a mathematical transformation of this approach has been proposed to account for the potential omission of latent spatial variables that may overestimate the impact of accessibility to mass transit systems on values. The development of a Difference-in-Differences (DID) estimator, based on the repeat-sales approach, is a move in the right direction. However, such an estimator neglects the possibility that specification of the price equation may follow a spatial autoregressive process with respect to the dependent variable. The objective of this paper is to propose a spatial Difference-in-Differences (SDID) estimator accounting for possible spatial spillover effects. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of a suitable weights matrix accounting for spatial links between observations. Finally, an empirical application of the SDID estimator based on the development of a new commuter rail transit system for the suburban agglomeration of Montr\'eal (Canada) is presented and compared to the usual DID estimator.},

In this study, we chose the Malian River basin to analyze the temporal and spatial variation of its runoff and sediment load, as well as the potential causes. The annual runoff and sediment load at six hydrological stations in the study area were collected for the period between 1960 and 2016. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were respectively applied to detect temporal variations and abrupt changes in the runoff and sediment loads. The results showed that an abrupt change in the runoff and sediment loads occurred in 2003. The average annual runoff in the Malian River was 4.42 x 10(8) m(3) yr(-1) from 1960 to 2002, and decreased to 3.32 x 10(8) m(3) yr(-1) in 2003-2016. The average annual sediment load was 1.27 x 10(8) t yr(-1) in 1960-2002, and decreased to 0.65 x 10(8) t yr(-1) in 2003-2016. The spatial patterns in the sediment load suggested that the Hongde sub-basin contributed a higher sediment count to the Malian River, which may require additional attention for soil and water conservation in the future. Anthropogenic activities significantly affected runoff and sediment load reduction according to the double-mass curve method, accounting for 90.7\% and 78.7\%, respectively, whereas rainfall changes were 9.3\% and 21.3\%, respectively. As such, the present study analyzed the loessial tableland runoff and sediment load characteristics of the Malian River basin for soil and water erosion management.},

  abstract = {Analyzing river basins as coupled human and hydrological systems is important to advance our understanding of hydrological processes, and to provide insights into policy design for water resources management. However, assessing spatially heterogeneous and temporally dynamic characteristics of human-hydrological interactions remains a challenge, and relevant research has been limited by the lack of computationally tractable models that can integrate water management policies, human activities, and hydrological conditions with sufficient temporal and spatial details. In this study, we propose a modeling framework that tightly couples (1) an agent-based model for farmers' decision-making on water use influenced by collective water management policies, and (2) a distributed hydrological model for simulating integrated groundwater-surface water processes with high spatial and temporal resolutions. We apply the modeling framework to the Heihe River Basin, a large semi-arid river basin with intensive agriculture in China. Through various policy portfolio analyses, the model has identified several unique spatial\textendash temporal characteristics of human-hydrological interactions. These include (1) nonlinear relationships between water policies, farmers' decisions on water use, and hydrological conditions, (2) spatially heterogeneous impacts of water policies on farmers' conjunctive groundwater and surface water use, and (3) location-dependent temporal patterns regarding water policies' influences on hydrological processes. It is found that regional hydrogeological conditions (e.g., depth to water table, distance to rivers) are key factors to influence human-hydrological interactions. The modeling results could advance our understanding of the role of human activities in hydrological cycles, and yield insights into the design of location-based policies for river basin management.},

  abstract = {Far from a uniform band, the biodiversity found across Earth's tropical moist forests varies widely between the high diversity of the Neotropics and Indomalaya and the relatively lower diversity of the Afrotropics. Explanations for this variation across different regions, the "pantropical diversity disparity" (PDD), remain contentious, due to difficulty teasing apart the effects of contemporary climate and paleoenvironmental history. Here, we assess the ubiquity of the PDD in over 150,000 species of terrestrial plants and vertebrates and investigate the relationship between the present-day climate and patterns of species richness. We then investigate the consequences of paleoenvironmental dynamics on the emergence of biodiversity gradients using a spatially explicit model of diversification coupled with paleoenvironmental and plate tectonic reconstructions. Contemporary climate is insufficient in explaining the PDD; instead, a simple model of diversification and temperature niche evolution coupled with paleoaridity constraints is successful in reproducing the variation in species richness and phylogenetic diversity seen repeatedly among plant and animal taxa, suggesting a prevalent role of paleoenvironmental dynamics in combination with niche conservatism. The model indicates that high biodiversity in Neotropical and Indomalayan moist forests is driven by complex macroevolutionary dynamics associated with mountain uplift. In contrast, lower diversity in Afrotropical forests is associated with lower speciation rates and higher extinction rates driven by sustained aridification over the Cenozoic. Our analyses provide a mechanistic understanding of the emergence of uneven diversity in tropical moist forests across 110 Ma of Earth's history, highlighting the importance of deep-time paleoenvironmental legacies in determining biodiversity patterns.},

This provides an indication of the potential degree of system-wide fit between an ecosystem and a relevant set of institutions. A preliminary form of the approach uses the text of ocean and coastal laws and regulations to represent formal institutional arrangements. This basic demonstration helps show the complex interrelationships that have to be taken into account in a systematic evaluation of fit. Beyond the first iteration, work continues on developing the analytical capacity of the framework and, therefore, its utility to assist, for example, in policy transitions, including those to ecosystem-based management.},

This paper takes a social-ecological resilience approach to investigate how this type of water management technology would influence agro-ecosystem dynamics, using a catchment in northeastern Tanzania as an example. The analysis finds that three external drivers (increasing dryspell frequency, population growth, and institutional changes) have interacted with a set of key variables in the studied system to shape a development trajectory over the past half-century where off-farm ecosystem services are being degraded while agricultural yields remain low and people remain poor. The analysis further finds that the evaluated SWSIs have the potential to destabilize feedbacks maintaining this social-ecological trap through several different mechanisms, and thereby open up for new development trajectories. A concluding discussion identifies a number of challenges to this type of transformation in sub-Saharan Africa, and outlines the type of investment approaches that would be needed to go from potential to reality.

  abstract = {While resilience has grown to become a well-established goal of policy and practice, assessing resilience remains an outstanding problem. To date, measurement has largely relied on the identification of proxy indicators, inevitably shaping what is measured in ways that reflect underlying assumptions, generalisations and approxi\- mations, and raising the question of whose values are being embedded into resilience. These concerns reflect recent interest in the role of recognition justice in resilience, and in particular how marginalisation from meaning-making processes creates the conditions for the inequitable distribution of outcomes in practice. Here, we propose a two stage, subjective approach to resilience assessment, starting with rapid household interviews that invite participants to assess the likely impact of multiple shock and stressor storylines. In a second step, participatory qualitative methods are employed to support inductive investigation of resilience focused on the factors that differentiate those reporting relatively high and low resilience. We illustrate this using fieldwork data from 569 households in Bangladesh. This subjective approach enables households to engage in the production of knowledge about their resilience, revealing two core features of situated heterogeneity: the forms of difference, and the underlying causes. Underlying causes arise from interactions and feedbacks between social, political, economic and institutional conditions that are highly context specific, while significant forms of difference include intra-community and scalar heterogeneity; vulnerability to specific or generalised shocks; and the role of undesirable practices in securing resilience. The results underline the need for resilience to be assessed in relation to local understandings of precarity, and through the expression of senses of justice that inform local conceptions of wellbeing. This means moving beyond positivist approaches and placing epistemic diversity at the centre of resilience assessment, enabling the production of a situated understanding of how and why resilience is differ\- entiated, and offering an analytical starting point from which policy and practice can drive towards equitable resilience.},

Each of these draws attention to different dimensions of social\textendash ecological systems, with their own unique set of evaluative criteria. Although diversity is generally beneficial for the production of knowledge, it can also pose immense challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to build theoretically rigorous and practically useful knowledge concerning the sustainability of social\textendash ecological systems.

  abstract = {Water is indispensable for Earth resilience and sustainable development. The capacity of social-ecological systems to deal with shocks, adapting to changing conditions and transforming in situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on the functions of water to e.g., regulate the Earth's climate, support biomass production, and supply water resources for human societies. However, massive, inter-connected, human interference involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam constructions, and land-use change have significantly disturbed these water functions and induced regime shifts in social-ecological systems. In many cases, changes in core water functions have pushed systems beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts in system feedback. Examples of such transgressions, where water has played a critical role, are collapse of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem degradation, and tropical forest dieback associated with self-amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks. Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water involved in water functions globally, and review the evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and non-linear tipping points in ecological and social systems through the lens of resilience theory. Based on the literature review, we synthesize the role of water in mediating different types of ecosystem regime shifts, and generalize the process by which life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays a fundamental role in providing social-ecological resilience, and suggest that further research is needed to understand how the erosion of water resilience at local and regional scale may potentially interact, cascade, or amplify through the complex, globally hyper-connected networks of the Anthropocene.},

  abstract = {The freshwater cycle over land is fundamental for sustainability and resilience, yet is extensively modified and shaped by a vast range of human interventions in the land, water, and climate systems. The consequences of human water-cycle modifications can be non-linear, delayed, and distributed across boundaries, sectors, and scale. This complexity renders freshwater challenges difficult to govern and manage. We here propose a framework for understanding water's many functions for supporting, regulating, and stabilizing hydro-climatic, hydro-ecological, and hydro-social systems. This framework recognizes human impacts on major partitioning points, interactions among water functions, and stabilization and destabilization processes. A functional understanding of the freshwater cycle can integrate with social-ecological resilience-building principles, complement existing water sustainability governance approaches, and highlight the potential need for Earth-system-level governance of water. Recognizing water's diverse functional roles for resilience may promote a new generation of holistic and integrative water-land-climate governance.},

  abstract = {The notions of virtual water flows provide important indicators to manifest the water consumption and allocation between different sectors via product transactions. However, the configuration of virtual water network (VWN) still needs further investigation to identify the water interdependency among different sectors as well as the network efficiency and stability in a socio-economic system. Ecological network analysis is chosen as a useful tool to examine the structure and function of VWN and the interactions among its sectors. A balance analysis of efficiency and redundancy is also conducted to describe the robustness (RVWN) of VWN. Then, network control analysis and network utility analysis are performed to investigate the dominant sectors and pathways for virtual water circulation and the mutual relationships between pairwise sectors. A case study of the Heihe River Basin in China shows that the balance between efficiency and redundancy is situated on the left side of the robustness curve with less efficiency and higher redundancy. The forestation, herding and fishing sectors and industrial sectors are found to be the 01_manuscript controllers. The network tends to be more mutualistic and synergic, though some competitive relationships that weaken the virtual water circulation still exist.},

  abstract = {River runoff is affected by many factors, including long-term effects such as climate change that alter rainfall-runoff relationships, and short-term effects related to human intervention (e.g., dam construction, land-use and land-cover change (LUCC)). Discharge from the Yellow River system has been modified in numerous ways over the past century, not only as a result of increased demands for water from agriculture and industry, but also due to hydrological disturbance from LUCC, climate change and the construction of dams. The combined effect of these disturbances may have led to water shortages. Considering that there has been little change in long-term precipitation, dramatic decreases in water discharge may be attributed mainly to human activities, such as water usage, water transportation and dam construction. LUCC may also affect water availability, but the relative contribution of LUCC to changing discharge is unclear. In this study, the impact of LUCC on natural discharge (not including anthropogenic usage) is quantified using an attribution approach based on satellite land cover and discharge data. A retention parameter is used to relate LUCC to changes in discharge. We find that LUCC is the primary factor, and more dominant than climate change, in driving the reduction in discharge during 1956-2012, especially from the mid-1980s to the end-1990s. The ratio of each land class to total basin area changed significantly over the study period. Forestland and cropland increased by about 0.58\% and 1.41\%, respectively, and unused land decreased by 1.16\%. Together, these variations resulted in changes in the retention parameter, and runoff generation showed a significant decrease after the mid-1980s. Our findings highlight the importance of LUCC to runoff generation at the basin scale, and improve our understanding of the influence of LUCC on basin-scale hydrology.},

  abstract = {Embodied water in a socio-economic system refers to the hidden water contained in products traded from one region or one sector to another and has been the center of concern for water management in recent years. However, most models developed for water system analysis ignore cycling and indirect flows, making it difficult to explain the effects of structure on these factors among sectors. Therefore, those models fail to examine the water utilization efficiency from an integral view. In this study, we investigate an embodied socio-economic water system using network analysis developed originally for ecological systems. In this manner, we identify structural and throughflow indicators, such as Finn Cycling Index, Indirect effects ratio, and aggradation, to show the efficiency of water utilization. The three indicators show different perspectives of the system's efficiency change over time, indicating that only the combination of these three indicators can provide a holistic portray about efficiency. Results showed that the structure influenced the cycling and indirect flows, and from a throughflow perspective, the system depends on large boundary inputs of fresh water. Furthermore, the values of Cycling Index and Indirect effect ratio are much lower than for natural food webs, implying that the policies that led to the structural change and reduction of boundary fresh water inputs do not lead to positive water utilization seen in natural systems. This study provides a novel perspective and methodology for assessing the structure and efficiency of water utilization system with a whole perspective.},

The non-linear variation in the Y-s-A can be explained as follows: the first peak value can be explained by the abrupt increase in slope gradient and flow shear stress resulting in highly increased sediment concentration and specific sediment yield. And the second peak value can be explained by the combined influence of flow shear stress and drainage density, represented by dimensionless variable Omega.},

The river flux has been decreasing dramatically; the discharges of water and sediment in the 1990s dropped to 27.4\% and 31.9\% of those in the 1950s, respectively, resulting in frequent and lengthy events of downstream channel dry-up since the 1970s. There were accumulatively 897 zero-flow days during the 1990s in the river course below the Lijin Hydrological Station, 100 km upstream from the river mouth, which is 82.4\% of that in 1972. As freshwater input decreases, river-borne nutrients to the estuarine increased significantly. Concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in the 1990s was four times of that in 1950s. Changes in amount and content of the riverine inputs have greatly affected the estuarine ecosystem. Over the past several decades, sea surface temperature and salinity in the estuary and its adjacent waters increased and their distribution pattern altered in response to the reduction of freshwater inflow. The distribution of and seasonal succession in nutrient concentrations in the surface layer have also changed with a shift of river outlet and the decrease in riverine nutrient loads. Furthermore, deterioration of estuarine ecosystem by less river input has decreased primary productivity in the deltaic region waters, and in turn depressed the fishery.

The results show that the morphological changes of the river mouth bar have been closely associated with the largely reduced fluvial discharge and sediment load. Landforrn development such as bar progradation occurred in two phases, i.e. before and after 1989, which correspond to faster and lower bar growth rates, respectively. Fast riverbed aggradation in the mouth channel was strongly related to river mouth bar progradation. During 1976-1996, about 2.8\% of the total sediment loads were deposited in the river channel on the upper to middle delta. Therefore, the river water level rose by a few meters from 1984 to 1996. The frequent distributary channel migration, which switched the radial channel pattern into the SE-directed pattern in the mid-1980s, was linked with mouth bar formation. Marine conditions also constrain seaward bar progradation. Furthermore, the history of river mouth bar formation reflects human impacts, such as dredging and dyking in order to stabilize the coastal area. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The Pettitt statistical method was used to test the abrupt changes in the time series of discharge and sediment concentration. The results indicate that the time series of discharge in Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reaches of the upper Yellow River can be divided into two periods, i.e., before 1969 and between 1969 and 1986. In these two periods, the third-order polynomial function could be used to describe the relationship between water discharge and SSC during the flood periods, indicating that sediment transport in the Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reaches was influenced by the complex processes of water and sediment inputs from the upstream and tributaries and also by the channel boundary conditions. The relation between SSC and the water discharge of low and moderate floods (Q {$<$} 3000 m(3)/s) was fitted by sediment rating curves of a power function form. The sediment rating parameter b is higher in the upper section of the Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reaches due to a higher stream power there, and both the cross-section shape and river bed material determine the value of log(a). Although a 40\% decrease in sediment transport during the flood periods due to the impoundment of the Liujiaxia Reservoir and sediment-checking dams and the implementation of soil and water conservation programmes in the Ningxia-Inner Mongolia reaches of the upper Yellow River, the sediment transport regimes during 1952-1986 did not change.

  abstract = {The Active Yellow River (Huanghe) Delta (AYRD) is a complex landform in which rapid deposition takes place due to its geologic formation and evolution. Continuous monitoring of shoreline dynamics at high temporal frequency is crucial for understanding the processes and the driving factors behind this rapidly changing coast. Great efforts have been devoted to map the changing shoreline of the Yellow River delta and explain such changes through remote sensing data. However, the temporal frequency of shoreline in the obtained datasets are generally not fine enough to reflect the detailed or subtly variable processes of shoreline retreat and advance. To overcome these limitations, we continuously monitored the dynamics of this shoreline using time series of Landsat data based on tidal-level calibration model and orthogonal-transect method. The Abrupt Change Value (ACV) results indicated that the retreat-advance patterns had a significant impact regardless of season or year. The Water-Sediment Regulation Scheme (WSRS) plays a dominant role in delivering river sediment discharge to the sea and has an impact on the annual average maximum ACV, especially at the mouth of the river. The positive relationship among the average ACV, runoff and sediment load are relatively obvious; however, we found that the Relative Exposure Index (REI) that measures wave energy was able to explain only approximately 20\% of the variation in the data. Based on the abrupt change at the shoreline of the AYRD, river flow and time, we developed a binary regression model to calculate the critical sediment load and water discharge for maintaining the equilibrium of the active delta from 2002 to 2015. These values were approximately 0.48 x 10(8) t/yr and 144.37 x 10(8) m(3)/yr. If the current water and sediment proportions released from the Xiaolangdi Reservoir during the WSRS remain stable, the erosion-accretion patterns of the active delta will shift from rapid accretion to a dynamic balance.

  abstract = {Most conventional hydrological time series models, used for forecasting or synthetic data generation, are based on the stationary hypothesis. Hydrologic variables such as surface runoff discharge exhibit non-stationary behavior due to the effects of climate change or human activities. In this paper, a new methodology is proposed to analyze the uncertainty of the number and location of breakpoints in runoff time series. The non-stationary runoff time series is simulated by segmenting the series into stationary pieces, which follow an Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) process, based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. The length of each piece and the order of the piecewise ARMA model are optimized using the Genetic Algorithm (GA). Several runoff time series with variable lengths are generated based on the observed data and the probability distribution function(s) (PDFs) of breakpoint location(s) are constructed. An optimal set of breakpoint locations are found for each generated runoff time series by minimizing the objective function based on the MDL. Finally, the PDF(s) of breakpoint location(s) is (are) constructed using the results of the mentioned optimization model. To evaluate the proposed methodology, it is applied to the case study of Zayandehrud River in Iran. According to the obtained breakpoint PDF for the runoff time series, three breakpoints around years of 1987, 1996 and 2006 are identified. The results are analyzed by investigating the time series of agricultural lands derived using remote sensing data and studying the impacts of interbasin water transfer projects implemented in the study area. Overall, investigating human-induced changes in the study area confirms the obtained shape of the PDF of runoff breakpoint and shows the good performance of the developed method for finding the number and location of breakpoints in the runoff time series.},

Data from two-stage decision tasks have seemingly shown that human behaviour is driven by both processes operating in parallel. However, in this study, we show that more detailed task instructions lead participants to make primarily model-based choices that have little, if any, simple model-free influence. We also demonstrate that behaviour in the two-stage task may falsely appear to be driven by a combination of simple model-free and model-based learning if purely model-based agents form inaccurate models of the task because of misconceptions. Furthermore, we report evidence that many participants do misconceive the task in important ways. Overall, we argue that humans formulate a wide variety of learning models. Consequently, the simple dichotomy of model-free versus model-based learning is inadequate to explain behaviour in the two-stage task and connections between reward learning, habit formation and compulsivity.},

Studying the effects of such extreme annual precipitation on soil erosion can deepen similar research and help predict environmental damage under future extreme rainfall. We selected the runoff plots (area: 4 m x 10 m) of three land-use types: cultivated land (C), wild grassland (W) and switchgrass (S). We monitored corresponding indices in the extreme year (2013) and normal year (2010-2012). The results were as follows: (1) The rainfall parameters (rainfall amount, EI30, EI60) in the extreme year were all higher than those in the normal year, especially in July; (2) In July and August, the runoff and soil loss of cultivated land in the extreme year increased by 1492.5\% and 538.2\%, respectively, compared to those in the normal year. The silt content of sediment was the highest generally, but the sand content increased relatively in the extreme year; (3) The effect of rainfall on soil erosion was the smallest in W; (4) In the extreme year, the same EI30 generated more runoff and soil loss than those in the normal year. The high antecedent precipitation which would cause high antecedent soil moisture was one of the reasons. The threshold value (100 MJmmha(-1)h(-1)) of EI30 related to extreme erosion risk was proposed.},

  abstract = {Human intervention has strongly altered patterns of river runoff. Yet, few studies have addressed the complexity and nonlinearity of the anthropogenic stresses on runoff or their interaction with climate. We study the Loess Plateau in China, whose river runoff contributes 65\% of the discharge to the middle reach of the Yellow River; this landscape has been shaped by human activity and is intensively managed. Our purpose is to characterize the interactive roles of climate and human activities in defining river runoff from the Loess Plateau. Applying a transient analysis to discover the time-varying runoff trend and impact factors, we found that the average runoff in the Loess Plateau decreased continuously during the period 1961-2009 (average rate of -0.9 mm year(-1) P {$<$} 0.001). This long-term decrease in runoff mainly occurred in three stages, with transitions in 1970,1981 and 1996. Reduced precipitation was the 01_manuscript reason for the decrease in runoff over the entire study period. However, human intervention played a dominant role in creating the transition. points. Water yield (i.e., the ratio of runoff to precipitation) decreased following each anthropogenic transition, causing a 56\% reduction in available freshwater resources during the period 1961-2009. These findings highlight the need for studies that address the dynamic and nonlinear processes controlling the availability of freshwater resources in the light of anthropogenic influences applied under a changing climate. Such studies are essential if we are to meet the human water demand in the Loess Plateau region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Potential connections between water discharge in the Yellow River Basin and El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) were also examined by the cross wavelet and wavelet coherence methods. CWT results show that the periodic oscillations in water discharges had occurred at the temporal scales of 1-, 2- to 4-, 6- to 8- and 10- to 22-year. It was also found that at the annual timescale (1-year) the phase relations between water discharge and ENSO were indistinct probably due to the strong influence by human disturbances. However, over the longer time scales, the phase relation becomes much clearer with an anti-phase relation being found mainly at inter-annual scale (2- to 8-year) and in-phase relation at decadal scale (16- to 22-year). According to the MK test results water discharge at most stations except Tangnaihai have decreased significantly and the abrupt change occurred in the mid-1980s or the early 1990s. The changes in water discharge were found to be influenced by both climate changes and human activities. Before 1970 the change in water discharge was positively related to precipitation variations in the river basin, but after 1970 the decrease in water discharge has been largely caused by various human activities including constructions of reservoirs, water abstraction and water-soil conservation with water abstraction being the 01_manuscript cause.},

Closing cultivation in a large scale has not resulted in decrease but increase of specific sediment yield of the catchment, in sharp decrease of the sediment yield and the relative sediment contribution of the inter-gully area, and in increase of the sediment yield and the contribution of the gully area, for a short term. The mean specific sediment yield of 29650 t km(-2) a(-1) of 1994-1996 in the catchment was 2.2 times the average value of 13413 1 km(-2) a(-1) for a long term. The specific sediment yield of the inter-gully area decreased from the 14335 t km(-2) a(-1) in 1994 to 7034 t km(-2) a(-1) in 1995 and 3517 t km(-2) a(-1) in 1996, while the yield of the gully area varied between 44944 and 62136 t km(-2) a(-1) during the period of 1994-1996 which was much greater than the value of 21118 t km(-2) a(-1) before 1993. The relative sediment contribution from the inter-gully area decreased from 23\% in 1994 to 15\% in 1995 and 6\% in 1996, while the contribution from the gully area increased from 77\% in 1994 to 85\% in 1995 and 94\% in 1996. It is suggested that compacting of ploughed soils resulted in increasing of the erosion resistance but in decreasing of the precipitation infiltration, therefore, the soil erosion reduced but the runoff amount increased on the inter-gully area. Increase of delivering runoff from the inter-gully area to the gully area should result in activeness of gully erosion and mass movements, consequently in increase of the total sediment yield from the catchment.},

However, environmental impacts associated with water consumption are largely neglected in these analyses. Incorporating water scarcity into water consumption allows better understanding of what is causing water scarcity and which regions are suffering from it. In this study, we incorporate water scarcity and ecosystem impacts into multiregional input\textendash output analysis to assess virtual water flows and associated impacts among 30 provinces in China. China, in particular its water-scarce regions, are facing a serious water crisis driven by rapid economic growth. Our findings show that inter-regional flows of virtual water reveal additional insights when water scarcity is taken into account. Consumption in highly developed coastal provinces is largely relying on water resources in the water-scarce northern provinces, such as Xinjiang, Hebei, and Inner Mongolia, thus significantly contributing to the water scarcity in these regions. In addition, many highly developed but water scarce regions, such as Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin, are already large importers of net virtual water at the expense of water resource depletion in other water scarce provinces. Thus, increasingly importing water-intensive goods from other water-scarce regions may just shift the pressure to other regions, but the overall water problems may still remain. Using the water footprint as a policy tool to alleviate water shortage may only work when water scarcity is taken into account and virtual water flows from water-poor regions are identified.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Socio-hydrology aims to understand the dynamics and co-evolution of coupled human\textendash water systems, with research consisting of generic models as well as specific case studies. In this paper, we propose a concept to help bridge the gap between these two types of socio-hydrological studies: socio-hydrological spaces (SHSs). A socio-hydrological space is a geographical area in a landscape. Its particular combination of hydrological and social features gives rise to the emergence of distinct interactions and dynamics (patterns) between society and water. Socio-hydrological research on human\textendash flood interactions has found two generic responses, ``fight'' or ``adapt''. Distilling the patterns resulting from these responses in case studies provides a promising way to relate contextual specificities to the generic patterns described by conceptual models. Through the use of SHSs, different cases can be compared globally without aspiring to capturing them in a formal model. We illustrate the use of SHS for the Jamuna floodplain, Bangladesh. We use narratives and experiences of local experts and inhabitants to empirically describe and delimit SHS. We corroborated the resulting classification through the statistical analysis of primary data collected for the purpose (household surveys and focus group discussions) and secondary data (statistics, maps etc.). Our example of the use of SHSs shows that the concept draws attention to how historical patterns in the co-evolution of social behaviour, natural processes and technological interventions give rise to different landscapes, different styles of living and different ways of organising livelihoods. This provides a texture to the more generic patterns generated by socio-hydrological models, promising to make the resulting analysis more directly useful for decision makers. We propose that the usefulness of this concept in other floodplains, and for other socio-hydrological systems than floodplains, should be explored.},

  abstract = {Coupled human and natural systems (CHANS) are complex, dynamic, interconnected systems with feedback across social and environmental dimensions. This feedback leads to formidable challenges for causal inference. Two significant challenges involve assumptions about excludability and the absence of interference. These two assumptions have been largely unexplored in the CHANS literature, but when either is violated, causal inferences from observable data are difficult to interpret. To explore their plausibility, structural knowledge of the system is requisite, as is an explicit recognition that most causal variables in CHANS affect a coupled pairing of environmental and human 01_manuscript. In a large CHANS literature that evaluates marine protected areas, nearly 200 studies attempt to make causal claims, but few address the excludability assumption. To examine the relevance of interference in CHANS, we develop a stylized simulation of a marine CHANS with shocks that can represent policy interventions, ecological disturbances, and technological disasters. Human and capital mobility in CHANS is both a cause of interference, which biases inferences about causal effects, and a moderator of the causal effects themselves. No perfect solutions exist for satisfying excludability and interference assumptions in CHANS. To elucidate causal relationships in CHANS, multiple approaches will be needed for a given causal question, with the aim of identifying sources of bias in each approach and then triangulating on credible inferences. Within CHANS research, and sustainability science more generally, the path to accumulating an evidence base on causal relationships requires skills and knowledge from many disciplines and effective academic-practitioner collaborations.},

  abstract = {Increasing attention to regime shifts, critical transitions, non-marginal changes, and systemic shocks calls for the development of models that are able to reproduce or grow structural changes that occur over time periods perceived as abrupt. This paper highlights specific modelling challenges to consider when exploring coupled socio-environmental systems experiencing regime shifts. We explore these challenges in the context of four modelling approaches that have been applied to the study of regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems: statistical, system dynamics, equilibrium and agent-based modelling. When reviewing these modelling approaches we reflect on a set of criteria including the ability of an approach (1) to capture feedbacks between social and environmental system, (2) to represent the sources of regime shifts, (3) to incorporate complexity aspects, and (4) to deal with regime shift identification. Many of the modelling examples considered do not provide information on all these criteria, which receive a lot of attention in empirical studies of registered regime shifts. This suggests a need to develop a common modelling terminology in the domain of modelling for resilience and regime shifts. When discussing strengths and weaknesses of various modelling paradigms we conclude that a hybrid approach is likely to provide most insights into the processes and consequences of regime shifts. Challenges and frontier directions of research for designing models to study regime shifts in coupled socio-environmental systems are outlined. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Here we quantify the magnitude of these twin challenges to urban water security, combining a dataset of urban water sources of 482 of the world's largest cities with estimates of future water demand, based on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Fifth Assessment scenarios, and predictions of future water availability, using the WaterGAP3 modelling framework. We project an urban surface-water deficit of 1,386\textendash 6,764 million m{$^3$}. More than 27\% of cities studied, containing 233 million people, will have water demands that exceed surface-water availability. An additional 19\% of cities, which are dependent on surface-water transfers, have a high potential for conflict between the urban and agricultural sectors, since both sectors cannot obtain their estimated future water demands. In 80\% of these high-conflict watersheds, improvements in agricultural water-use efficiency could free up enough water for urban use. Investments in improving agricultural water use could thus serve as an important global change adaptation strategy.},

This article presents the origin of the resilience perspective and provides an overview of its development to date. With roots in one branch of ecology and the discovery of multiple basins of attraction in ecosystems in the 1960-1970s, it inspired social and environmental scientists to challenge the dominant stable equilibrium view. The resilience approach emphasizes non-linear dynamics, thresholds, uncertainty and surprise, how periods of gradual change interplay with periods of rapid change and how such dynamics interact across temporal and spatial scales. The history was dominated by empirical observations of ecosystem dynamics interpreted in mathematical models, developing into the adaptive management approach for responding to ecosystem change. Serious attempts to integrate the social dimension is currently taking place in resilience work reflected in the large numbers of sciences involved in explorative studies and new discoveries of linked social-ecological systems. Recent advances include understanding of social processes like, social learning and social memory, mental models and knowledge-system integration, visioning and scenario building, leadership, agents and actor groups, social networks, institutional and organizational inertia and change, adaptive capacity, transformability and systems of adaptive governance that allow for management of essential ecosystem services.

These aspects interrelate across multiple scales. Resilience in this context is the capacity of a SES to continually change and adapt yet remain within critical thresholds. Adaptability is part of resilience. It represents the capacity to adjust responses to changing external drivers and internal processes and thereby allow for development along the current trajectory (stability domain). Transformability is the capacity to cross thresholds into new development trajectories. Transformational change at smaller scales enables resilience at larger scales. The capacity to transform at smaller scales draws on resilience from multiple scales, making use of crises as windows of opportunity for novelty and innovation, and recombining sources of experience and knowledge to navigate social-ecological transitions. Society must seriously consider ways to foster resilience of smaller more manageable SESs that contribute to Earth System resilience and to explore options for deliberate transformation of SESs that threaten Earth System resilience.},

This cooling trend is offset by \textasciitilde 20\% reduction in global SO2 emissions that weakens the aerosol cooling effect, causing short-term warming. As a result, we estimate that the direct effect of the pandemic-driven response will be negligible, with a cooling of around 0.01\,{$\pm$}\,0.005\,\textdegree C by 2030 compared to a baseline scenario that follows current national policies. In contrast, with an economic recovery tilted towards green stimulus and reductions in fossil fuel investments, it is possible to avoid future warming of 0.3\,\textdegree C by 2050.},

This is especially the case in their mountainous stretches, where harsh terrain is seen as an impediment to travel. Considering the ecology and mobility of inner Asian mountain pastoralists, we use `flow accumulation' modelling to calculate the annual routes of nomadic societies (from 750\,m to 4,000\,m elevation). Aggregating 500 iterations of the model reveals a high-resolution flow network that simulates how centuries of seasonal nomadic herding could shape discrete routes of connectivity across the mountains of Asia. We then compare the locations of known high-elevation Silk Road sites with the geography of these optimized herding flows, and find a significant correspondence in mountainous regions. Thus, we argue that highland Silk Road networks (from 750\,m to 4,000\,m) emerged slowly in relation to long-established mobility patterns of nomadic herders in the mountains of inner Asia.},

  abstract = {Coastal wetlands, which are fragile and intricate ecosystems with continuously changing salinity and moisture, are especially sensitive to climate changes and anthropogenic activities. As a typical coastal wetland in North China, the Chenier Island of the Yellow River Delta served as the study area to demonstrate the composition, seasonal variations, and salinization characteristics of soil salinity in different seasons. A total of 144 soil samples from 0 cm to 60 cm depth in the coastal zone were comprehensively studied during pre-, among and post-monsoon seasons of 2015. Soil salt contents, anions and cations in the beach, seaward side, dune crest, and landside were quantitatively analyzed through field sampling and experimental determination, and the ion composition, seasonal dynamics, and salinization characteristics of soil salinity in different microtopography types were explored. Physicochemical data revealed that soil salinity changed with the seasons and ranged from 0.76 g.kg(-1) to 13.57 g.kg(-1) during the sampling period. Soil salinity exhibited distinct spatial heterogeneity and was high in landside and low in dune crest and seaward side along the Chenier Island of the Yellow River Delta. Considering the soil texture, the soil salinity of coastal saline soils was higher than that of shell sandy soils. Salt migration demonstrated seasonality, and soil salinity presented a downward trend in the rainy season, thereby showing a bottom accumulation pattern. Soil salinity tended to move upwards with capillary action in the absence of rain interference in the dry season, which reveals a surface accumulation pattern. The relationship among soil salt content and Na+, Mg2+, Cl-, and SO42- showed an extremely significant positive correlation at the 0.01 level, and that relationship between soil salt content and K+ showed a significant positive correlation at the 0.05 level. However, the correlation with Ca2+ was insignificant at the 0.05 level. Despite the high content of Ca2+, the ions of Na+, Cl-, and SO42- dominated salinity. Additionally, the present study indicated that soil salinity demonstrated seasonality in the order of spring {$>$} autumn {$>$} summer, and summer was selected as the optimal desalination time. The salinization situation among different microtopographies exhibited some differences, the soil was seriously salinized in the landside and beach, but only nonsalinization or mild salinization was found in the seaward side and dune crest. Furthermore, shell sand in the Chenier Island of the Yellow River Delta could provide a favorable soil habitat for plant settlement and create advantageous conditions for the increase in biodiversity, which would provide a scientific basis for soil management and ecological restoration.

  abstract = {The discipline of geography encompasses both natural and social sciences and has the natural advantage of enabling the study of sustainability from a transdisciplinary perspective. There are great opportunities for geographers to participate in sustainability research. However, while geographers have set sustainability goals, they have rarely clarified the details for reaching those goals. Current knowledge on the relationship between humans and the environment and the methodologies for studying this relationship are inadequate to solve the transdisciplinary questions in sustainability science. Five research areas: geographical processes; ecosystem services and human wellbeing; human-environmental systems; sustainable development; and geo-data and modelling for sustainability are proposed as those needed to help geography achieve sustainability. The key objective of promoting geography for sustainability is to reveal the mechanisms of human-environmental system dynamics. This depends on understanding the processes in the natural and social systems and their mutual feedback as well as clarifying the relationships between the structures, functional characteristics and interactions in the human-environmental systems at multiple scales. The advancement of geography and its methodologies and technologies will provide a more profound understanding of the future. Geographers have the responsibility of promoting the discipline as the key pathway for carrying natural and social sciences towards sustainability.},

Less explored is whether biodiversity changes are accompanied by a modification of interaction networks. We use data from 32 spatial interaction networks from different ecosystems to analyse how network structure changes with area. We find that basic community structure descriptors (number of species, links and links per species) increase with area following a power law. Yet, the distribution of links per species varies little with area, indicating that the fundamental organization of interactions within networks is conserved. Our null model analyses suggest that the spatial scaling of network structure is determined by factors beyond species richness and the number of links. We demonstrate that biodiversity\textendash area relationships can be extended from species counts to higher levels of network complexity. Therefore, the consequences of anthropogenic habitat destruction may extend from species loss to wider simplification of natural communities.},

The Huanghe, China, provides a rare opportunity to test emerging theories because its high sediment load produces regular avulsions at two distinct nodes. Where the river debouches from the Loess Plateau, avulsions occur at an abrupt decrease in bed slope and reoccur at a time interval (607years) consistent with a channel-filling timescale set by the superelevation height of the levees. Downstream, natural deltaic avulsions reoccur at a timescale that is fast (7years) compared to channel-filling timescale due to large stage-height variability during floods. Unlike the upstream node, deltaic avulsions cluster at a location influenced by backwater hydrodynamics and show evidence for episodic downstream migration in concert with progradation of the shoreline, providing new expectations for the interplay between avulsion location, frequency, shoreline rugosity, and delta morphology.},

  abstract = {Over the past five decades, under the joint influence of climate change and human activity, river runoff in most areas of Loess Plateau showed a significant declining trend, which poses a great threat to ecological security and land degradation and soil erosion control. To identify the key factors controlling this decline and quantify the contribution rates of the multiple factors, a runoff simulation was established based on the Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), and the influence of climatic and anthropogenic factors on runoff change was calculated by comparing the results of the simulation based on different modeling scenarios. First, the impact of climatic factors on runoff change was gradually decreasing over time, and the anthropogenic factors' impact was increasing based on the runoff observations. Second, the SWAT model proved to be reliable and acceptable for both the calibration and the validation periods, with R- 2 and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values both above .8. Third, the influence of climatic factors decreases from 85.70\% to 42.43\% but that of anthropogenic factors increases from 14.3\% to 57.57\% in different subperiods. Among the anthropogenic factors, the influence of the direct factor (water withdrawal) is growing the fastest, and the influence of indirect factors is increasing continuously. Therefore, future ecological management and water-related planning in Loess Plateau should consider the importance of human activity and the relationship between humans and the Earth. Finally, a range of comprehensive countermeasures are proposed to assist with sustainable watershed management in the Loess Plateau.},

In this paper, based on the precipitation, streamflow and sediment discharge series data (1950-2008), the streamflow and sediment discharge variation and its impact on precipitation/response to human activities have been analysis. The results show that significant decreasing trends in annual streamflow and sediment discharge have existed since the late 1950s in the middle reaches of the Yellow River (P = 0.01). Change-point analyses further revealed that transition years existed and that abrupt decline in streamflow and sediment discharge began in 1985 and 1981, respectively, in the middle reaches of the Yellow River (P = 0.05). Adoption of conservation measures in the 1980s and 1990s corroborates the identified transition years. Double-mass curves of precipitation vs. streamflow (sediment) for the periods before and after the transition year show remarkable decreases in proportionality of streamflow (sediment) generation. Compared with the period before the transition year, cumulative streamflow and cumulative sediment discharge reduced respectively by 17.8\% and 28\% during 1985-2008, which was caused by human intervention, in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. It is, therefore, concluded that human activities occupied a dominant position and played a major role in the streamflow and sediment discharge reduction in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.},

We simulated the ET variation in a rain-fed spring maize field in the eastern Loess Plateau using the Pemnan-Monteith (PM), Shuttleworth-Wallace (SW), and modified Priestley-Taylor (PTm) models. Then we compared their results with the observed ET using the eddy covariance (EC) method. Generally, the diurnal variation in estimated ET from the three models was similar to that of observed ET by the EC method. However, the PM model significantly underestimated ET. The ET estimates obtained from the SW and PTm models were approximately equal to the observed ET by the EC method. Considering the PTm model's simplicity, we fmally recommend it for rain-fed spring maize fields in the Loess Plateau. After precipitation, the estimated ET from the three models was significantly smaller than measured ET by the EC method, especially the PM model. After a frost, all three models failed to reflect the dramatic decrease in crop transpiration, and thus significantly overestimated ET.},

  abstract = {The middle reaches of the Yellow River Basin transport the vast majority of sediment ({$>$}85\% of the basin's total available sediment load), which has had profound effects on the characteristics of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Since the late 1950s, soil and water conservation measures have been extensively implemented in the Loess Plateau, China, especially since the 1970s. This has resulted in sediment discharge changing significantly. In this study, data from 22 catchments in the region of the Loess Plateau from Hekou to Longmen in the middle reaches of the Yellow River were analyzed to investigate the responses of the sediment regime to climate change and human activities. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and the Pettitt test were used to identify trends and shifts in sediment discharge. All 22 catchments had a significantly decreasing trend (P {$<$} 0.01) in annual sediment discharge. Change point years were detected between 1971 and 1994, and were concentrated between 1978 and 1984 in 17 catchments. Moreover, erosive rainfall exhibited a tendency to decrease, but this was not a significant trend. Compared to rainfall, human activities, primarily soil and water conservation and environmental rehabilitation campaigns, have played a more prominent role in the changes in sediment regimes. In order to reduce soil erosion and sediment yield, more attention should be paid to proper and rational soil and water conservation and eco-restoration in this region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, the relative impacts of VPD and SMC on LUE are unclear, as we lack a mechanistic understanding of impacts and their interactions. In this study, we quantified the relative roles of VPD and SMC in limiting LUE and analysed the interactions among VPD, SMC and LUE using data from CO2 and water flux stations and weather stations along a climatic gradient in the Heihe River Basin, China. We found a threshold of VPD constraint on LUE; above the threshold, LUE decreased at only 3.6\% to 23.1\% of the rate below the threshold. As SMC decreased, however, the VPD threshold increased, and the reduction of LUE caused by VPD decreased significantly, which is more than half of that in moister regions. Therefore, both VPD and SMC played essential roles in LUE limitation caused by water stress. A threshold also existed for heat flux and the correlation between SMC and LUE; the strength of the correlation first decreased and then increased with increasing VPD. Our results clarified the relative impacts of VPD and SMC on LUE, and can improve simulation and prediction of plant productivity.},

  abstract = {Plateau wetlands in the Yellow River Source Zone are distributed in a wide range of geomorphic zones. They can be classified as alpine, piedmont, valley, floodplain, lacustrine, riverine and terrace wetlands on the basis of this geomorphic association. Some wetland types have shown signs of degradation triggered by environmental desiccation and improper land management strategies. The degradation process is characterized by four stages: intact, slight (dryland), severe (wasteland) and extreme (badland). Wetland degradation can be reversible or irreversible, depending on whether the tolerant threshold of the wetland ecosystem has been exceeded. The change from healthy wetland to dryland is considered quantitative and reversible, in that only the water reserve in the wetland system has been reduced whilst most of its ecosystem functions are retained. Beyond the dryland stage, degradation is considered irreversible in that external intervention is essential to rehabilitate the degraded system via minimizing human disturbance, and even engineering work may be needed. Both the process and the severity of degradation can be considerably accelerated by the joint effect of multiple degradation drivers that far exceeds the sum effect of individual factors. The severity of wetland degradation is commonly assessed from biological and hydrological indicators, including vegetative cover and proportion of original plants, surface water reserve and soil moisture, and the level of soil erosion induced by rodent burrowing. To be effective, any rehabilitative measures of degraded wetland must target the roots of the degradation problem, which are likely to be site-specific.},

We make use of online data by analyzing viewership statistics of Wikipedia articles on aircraft crashes. We study the relation between recent events and past events and particularly focus on understanding memory-triggering patterns. We devise a quantitative model that explains the flow of viewership from a current event to past events based on similarity in time, geography, topic, and the hyperlink structure of Wikipedia articles. We show that, on average, the secondary flow of attention to past events generated by these remembering processes is larger than the primary attention flow to the current event. We report these previously unknown cascading effects.},

Innovations in soil and water management, especially in the drylands, are critical for meeting food security and water productivity targets of Agenda 2030. This study analyzes how rainfed agriculture can be intensified with marginal impact on the landscape water balance. The impact of rainwater harvesting structures on landscape hydrology and associated agricultural services was analyzed in the semi-arid Jhansi district of Bundelkhand region in central India. The Parasai-Sindh pilot watershed was subjected to a 5-year (2012\textendash 2016) monitoring of rainfed system improvements in water availability and crop intensification due to surface water storage (haveli system), check dams, and field infiltration structures. Hydrological processes were monitored intensively to analyze the landscape's water balance components. Rainwater harvesting (RWH) structures altered the landscape's hydrology, limiting average surface runoff from 250~mm/year to 150~mm/year over the study period. Groundwater levels increased by 2\textendash 5~m (m), alleviating water scarcity issues of the communities in recurring dry years. Nearly 20\% of fallow lands were brought under cultivation. Crop yields increased by 10\textendash 70\% and average household income increased from US\$ 960/year to US\$ 2700/year compared to that in the non-intervention landscape. The combined soil\textendash water\textendash vegetation efforts strengthened water resilience and environmental systems in agricultural landscape.},

  abstract = {This article deals with the systems level in Freeman and Perez's innovation typology (incremental, radical, system, techno-economic paradigm). Transitions at this level are understood as changes from one socio-technical system to another, involving co-evolution of technology and society. To understand these transitions, the article describes a multi-level perspective, based on insights from sociology of technology and evolutionary economics. This perspective is used to analyse a detailed historical case study, the transition from surface water to piped water and personal hygiene (1870\textendash 1930). By the middle of the 19th century, problems in the water supply regime grew worse, as expanding urban populations dumped their waste in canals and surface waters. Local conditions in some specific cities provided space for the first piped water systems in the 1850s. Problems in the water supply regime grew worse in the 1860s and 1870s, but public authorities in other cities did not embrace the new niche. Instead, they searched for solutions within the existing regime. Only after wider landscape developments in the 1880s and 1890s (economic, cultural, political) could the niche break through and trigger wider transformations. So external macro-developments played a crucial role in the take-off and diffusion phase of this transition. This transition is a good example of co-evolution of technology and society, involving technological innovations, such as piped water infrastructure, soap, toilets, baths, as well as cultural, political, economic and behavioural changes. The case study illustrates how the multi-level perspective can be used to analyse how these changes influenced each other in a co-evolution process. The article thus fits in the growing literature on co-evolution. While most literatures look at co-evolution between two or three aspects, this article develops a broader understanding of co-evolution.},

  abstract = {Many large-scale water resources systems, especially in transboundary contexts, are characterized by the presence of several and conflicting interests and managed by multiple, institutionally independent decision makers. These systems are often studied adopting a centralized approach based on the assumption of full cooperation and information exchange among the involved parties. Such a perspective is conceptually interesting to quantify the best achievable performance but might have little practical impact given the real political and institutional setting. In this work, we propose a novel decision-analytic framework based on multiagent systems to model and analyze different levels of cooperation and information exchange among multiple decision makers. The Zambezi River basin is used as a case study. According to the proposed agent-based optimization approach, each agent represents a decision maker, whose decisions are defined by an explicit optimization problem considering only the agent's local interests. The economic value of information exchange is estimated comparing a noncooperative setting, where agents act independently, with the first basic level of cooperation, i.e., coordination, characterized by full information exchange. The economic value of cooperation is also estimated by comparison with the ideal, fully cooperative management of the system. Results show that coordination, obtained with complete information exchange, allows the downstream agents to better adapt to the upstream behaviors. The impact of information exchange depends on the objective considered, and we show coordination to be particularly beneficial to environmental interests.},

We use geomatic synthesis of hydrologic, geologic and topographic data sets to quantify and map water-table type over the contiguous United States using a dimensionless criterion introduced by Haitjema and Mitchell-Bruker (2005), called the water-table ratio, which differentiates water-table type. Our analysis indicates that specific regions of the United States have broadly contiguous and characteristic water-table types. Water-table ratio relates to water-table depth and the potential for regional groundwater flow. In regions with recharge-controlled water tables, for example the Southwest or Rocky Mountains, USA, water-tables depths are generally greater and more variable and regional groundwater flow is generally more important as a percentage of the watershed budget. Water-table depths are generally shallow and less variable, and regional groundwater flow is limited in areas with topography-controlled water tables such as the Northeast USA. The water-table ratio is a simple but powerful criterion for evaluating regional groundwater systems over broad areas.},

The average polygon size in the new map is \textasciitilde 100 km2, which is a more than hundredfold increase in resolution compared to the previous map which has an average polygon size of \textasciitilde 14,000 km2. We also significantly improve the representation in regions of weathered tropical soils and permafrost.

The objective of this review is to provide a clear portrait of global-scale groundwater sustainability, systems, and resources in the Anthropocene to inspire a pivot toward more sustainable pathways of groundwater use. We examine groundwater from three different but related perspectives of sustainability science, natural resource governance and management, and Earth System science. An Earth System approach thus highlights the connections between groundwater and the other parts of the system and how these connections are impacting, or are impacted by, groundwater pumping. Groundwater is the largest store of unfrozen freshwater on Earth and is heterogeneously connected to many Earth System processes on different timescales. We propose a definition of groundwater sustainability that has a direct link with observable data, governance, and management as well as the crucial functions and services of groundwater.},

  abstract = {Continental- to global-scale hydrologic models increasingly include representations of the Earth's groundwater system. A key question is how to evaluate the realism and performance quality of such large-scale groundwater models given limitations in data availability. We argue for a transparent approach to system conceptualization, which would enable distinguishing differences in model behavior that are caused by system conceptualization from those that are caused by differences in the implementation of physical processes in models. In addition, we argue for systematic model classification to distinguish the impacts of choices in model implementation. Evaluation options include comparing model outputs with available observations of groundwater levels or other state or flux variables (data-driven evaluation); comparing several models with each other with or without reference to actual observations (model-driven evaluation); or relying on experts to propose hydrologic behaviors that we expect to see in particular regions or at particular times (expert-driven evaluation). We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of these three evaluation strategies as well as how they might be integrated to achieve a more holistic approach. We call on various scientific communities to join us in our effort to improve the representation of groundwater in continental to global models using the recommendations discussed here.},

However, the planetary boundary for human freshwater use has been critiqued as a singular measure that does not reflect all types of human interference with the complex global water cycle and Earth System. We suggest that the water planetary boundary will be more scientifically robust and more useful in decision-making frameworks if it is redesigned to consider more specifically how climate and living ecosystems respond to changes in the different forms of water on Earth: atmospheric water, frozen water, groundwater, soil moisture, and surface water. This paper provides an ambitious scientific road map to define a new water planetary boundary consisting of sub-boundaries that account for a variety of changes to the water cycle.},

As populations and economies grow, new constraints on water resources are appearing, raising questions about limits to water availability. Such resource questions are not new. The specter of ``peak oil''\textemdash a peaking and then decline in oil production\textemdash has long been predicted and debated. We present here a detailed assessment and definition of three concepts of ``peak water'': peak renewable water, peak nonrenewable water, and peak ecological water. These concepts can help hydrologists, water managers, policy makers, and the public understand and manage different water systems more effectively and sustainably. Peak renewable water applies where flow constraints limit total water availability over time. Peak nonrenewable water is observable in groundwater systems where production rates substantially exceed natural recharge rates and where overpumping or contamination leads to a peak of production followed by a decline, similar to more traditional peak-oil curves. Peak ``ecological'' water is defined as the point beyond which the total costs of ecological disruptions and damages exceed the total value provided by human use of that water. Despite uncertainties in quantifying many of these costs and benefits in consistent ways, more and more watersheds appear to have already passed the point of peak water. Applying these concepts can help shift the way freshwater resources are managed toward more productive, equitable, efficient, and sustainable use.},

  abstract = {Socio-hydrology views human activities as endogenous to water system dynamics; it is the interaction between human and biophysical processes that threatens the viability of current water systems through positive feedbacks and unintended consequences. Di Baldassarre et al. implement socio-hydrology as a flood risk problem using the concept of social memory as a vehicle to link human perceptions to flood damage. Their mathematical model has heuristic value in comparing potential flood damages in green versus technological societies. It can also support communities in exploring the potential consequences of policy decisions and evaluating critical policy tradeoffs, for example, between flood protection and economic development. The concept of social memory does not, however, adequately capture the social processes whereby public perceptions are translated into policy action, including the pivotal role played by the media in intensifying or attenuating perceived flood risk, the success of policy entrepreneurs in keeping flood hazard on the public agenda during short windows of opportunity for policy action, and different societal approaches to managing flood risk that derive from cultural values and economic interests. We endorse the value of seeking to capture these dynamics in a simplified conceptual framework, but favor a broader conceptualization of socio-hydrology that includes a knowledge exchange component, including the way modeling insights and scientific results are communicated to floodplain managers. The social processes used to disseminate the products of socio-hydrological research are as important as the research results themselves in determining whether modeling is used for real-world decision making.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a conceptual framework for both assessing the role of economic instruments, and reshaping them in order to enhance their contribution to the goals of managing water scarcity. Water management problems stem from the mismatch between a multitude of individual decisions, on the one hand, and the current and projected status of water resources on the other. Economics can provide valuable incentives that drive individual decisions, and can design efficient instruments to address water governance problems in a context of conflicting interests and relevant transaction costs. Yet, instruments such as water pricing or trading are mostly based on general principles of welfare economics that are not readily applicable to assets as complex as water. A flaw in welfare economic approaches lies in the presumption that economic instruments may be good or bad on their own (e.g., finding the ``right'' price). This vision changes radically when we focus on the problem, instead of the instrument. In this paper, we examine how economic instruments to achieve welfare-enhancing water resource outcomes can realize their full potential in basin-scale management contexts. We follow a political economy perspective that views conflicts between public and private interest as the 01_manuscript instrumental challenge of water management. Our analysis allows us to better understand the critical importance of economic instruments for reconciling individual actions towards collective ambitions of water efficiency, equity and sustainability with lessons for later-adopting jurisdictions. Rather than providing panaceas, the successful design and implementation of economic instruments as key river basin management arrangements involves high transaction costs, wide institutional changes and collective action at different levels.},

For analysis of the changes in this area, this article presents a novel change-detection method based on a local fit-search model and kernel-induced graph cuts in multitemporal synthetic aperture radar images. Change detection involves assigning a label to every pixel. This task is naturally formulated in terms of energy minimization, which can be effectively solved by graph cuts. The difference image is transformed implicitly by a kernel function so that an alternative to complex modelling of the original data makes the piecewise constant model become applicable for graph cuts formulation. An issue is that graph cuts are sensitive to the initial estimate. The local fit-search model is proposed to approximate to the local histogram while selecting an optimal threshold for the initial labelling, which leads to an effective constraint for graph cuts and computational benefits as well. Visual and quantitative analyses obtained on the Yellow River Estuary data set confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method and that it outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods of change detection.},

The hydrology of the YR has changed dramatically due to the climate changes and water management practices, which have resulted in a great variation in the fluxes of riverine nutrients carried by the YR. To study these changes dissolved nutrients in the YR were measured monthly at Lijin station in the downstream region of the YR from 2002 to 2004. This study provides detailed information on the nutrient status for the relevant studies in the lower YR and the Bohai Sea. The YR was enriched in nitrate (average 314 molL(-1)) with a lower concentration of dissolved silicate (average 131 molL(-1)) and relatively low dissolved phosphate (average 0.35 molL(-1)). Nutrient concentrations exhibited substantial seasonal and yearly variations. The annual fluxes of dissolved inorganic nitrogen, phosphate, and silicate in 2004 were 5.3, 2.5, and 4.2 times those in 2002, respectively, primarily due to the increase in river discharge. The relative contributions of nutrient inputs to nitrogen in the YR were: wastewater {$>$} fertilizer {$>$} atmospheric deposition {$>$} soil; while to phosphorus were: wastewater {$>$} fertilizer {$>$} soil {$>$} atmospheric deposition. The ratios of N, P and Si suggest that the YR at Lijin is strongly P-limited with respect to potential phytoplankton growth.},

Here, we evaluate the distribution and equity of changes in ES benefits across demographic and socioeconomic groups in the United States (US) between 2020 and 2100. Specifically, we use land cover and population projections to model potential shifts in the supply, demand, and benefits of the following ES: provision of clean air, protection against a vector-borne disease (West Nile virus), and crop pollination. Across the US, changes in ES benefits are unevenly distributed among socioeconomic and demographic groups and among rural and urban communities, but are relatively uniform across geographic regions. In general, non-white, lower-income, and urban populations disproportionately bear the burden of declines in ES benefits. This is largely driven by the conversion of forests and wetlands to cropland and urban land cover in counties where these populations are expected to grow. In these locations, targeted land use policy interventions are required to avoid exacerbating inequalities already present in the US.},

Identifying the minimal set of units to attack to disintegrate a complex network, i.e. network dismantling, is a computationally challenging (NP-hard) problem which is usually attacked with heuristics. Here, we show that a machine trained to dismantle relatively small systems is able to identify higher-order topological patterns, allowing to disintegrate large-scale social, infrastructural and technological networks more efficiently than human-based heuristics. Remarkably, the machine assesses the probability that next attacks will disintegrate the system, providing a quantitative method to quantify systemic risk and detect early-warning signals of system's collapse. This demonstrates that machine-assisted analysis can be effectively used for policy and decision-making to better quantify the fragility of complex systems and their response to shocks.},

We find widespread biodiversity-profit trade-offs resulting from land-use transitions from forest and agroforestry systems to rubber and oil palm monocultures, for 26,894 aboveground and belowground species and whole-ecosystem multidiversity. Despite variation between ecosystem functions, profit gains come at the expense of ecosystem multifunctionality, indicating far-reaching ecosystem deterioration. We identify landscape compositions that can mitigate trade-offs under optimal land-use allocation but also show that intensive monocultures always lead to higher profits.

These changes threaten established shellfish fisheries and modify a variety of other ecosystem services. The diverse social and economic consequences of this trophic cascade are unknown, particularly across large regions. We developed and applied a trophic model to predict these impacts on four ecosystem services. Results suggest that sea otter presence yields 37\% more total ecosystem biomass annually, increasing the value of finfish [+9.4 million Canadian dollars (CA\$)], carbon sequestration (+2.2 million CA\$), and ecotourism (+42.0 million CA\$). To the extent that these benefits are realized, they will exceed the annual loss to invertebrate fisheries (-\$7.3 million CA\$). Recovery of keystone predators thus not only restores ecosystems but can also affect a range of social, economic, and ecological benefits for associated communities.},

  abstract = {Free-flowing rivers (FFRs) support diverse, complex and dynamic ecosystems globally, providing important societal and economic services. Infrastructure development threatens the ecosystem processes, biodiversity and services that these rivers support. Here we assess the connectivity status of 12 million kilometres of rivers globally and identify those that remain free-flowing in their entire length. Only 37 per cent of rivers longer than 1,000 kilometres remain free-flowing over their entire length and 23 per cent flow uninterrupted to the ocean. Very long FFRs are largely restricted to remote regions of the Arctic and of the Amazon and Congo basins. In densely populated areas only few very long rivers remain free-flowing, such as the Irrawaddy and Salween. Dams and reservoirs and their up- and downstream propagation of fragmentation and flow regulation are the leading contributors to the loss of river connectivity. By applying a new method to quantify riverine connectivity and map FFRs, we provide a foundation for concerted global and national strategies to maintain or restore them.},

  abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven 01_manuscript: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers.},

  abstract = {Hydrological regimes in the Yellow River have changed significantly because of climate change and intensive human interventions. These changes present severe challenges to water resource utilization and ecological development. Variation of run-off, suspended sediment load (SSL), and eight precipitation indices (P1: 0-12mm.day(-1), P12: 12-25mm.day(-1), P25: 25-50mm.day(-1), P50: P50mm.day(-1) and corresponding rainfall day: Pd1, Pd12, Pd25, Pd50dayyear(-1)) in three critical parts of the Yellow River basin (source region: SRYRB, upper reaches: URYRB, middle reaches: MRYRB) were investigated for the period from 1960 to 2015. The results show that run-off and SSL significantly decreased (P{$<$}0.01) in the URYRB and the MRYRB, whereas their decline in the SRYRB was insignificant (P{$>$}0.05). Moreover, run-off in the URYRB had one change point in 1987, and SSL in the URYRB as well as run-off and SSL in the MRYRB had two change points (in the 1970s and the 1990s). Over the same period, only Pd1 and Pd12 in the SRYRB showed significant increasing trends, and an abrupt change appeared in 1981. The optimal precipitation indices for assessing the effects of precipitation on run-off and SSL in the URYRB and MRYRB were Pd50 and P12, respectively. A double-mass curve analysis showed that precipitation and human activities contributed to approximately 20\% and 80\% of the reduction in run-off, respectively, for both the SRYRB and the MRYRB. However, the contribution rate of precipitation and human activities on SSL reduction was approximately 40\% and 60\% in the URYRB and 5\% and 95\% in the MRYRB, respectively. Human activities, primarily soil and water conservation measures and water extraction (diversion), were the 01_manuscript factors ({$>$}50\%) that reduced the run-off. However, the dominant driving factors for SSL reduction were soil and water conservation measures and reservoir interception, for which the contribution rate was higher than 70\% in the MRYRB. This work strengthens the understanding of hydrological responses to precipitation change and provides a useful reference for regional water resource utilization.},

  abstract = {Many of the challenges conservation professionals face can be framed as scale mismatches. The problem of scale mismatch occurs when the planning for and implementation of conservation actions is at a scale that does not reflect the scale of the conservation problem. The challenges in conservation planning related to scale mismatch include ecosystem or ecological process transcendence of governance boundaries; limited availability of fine-resolution data; lack of operational capacity for implementation; lack of understanding of social-ecological system components; threats to ecological diversity that operate at diverse spatial and temporal scales; mismatch between funding and the long-term nature of ecological processes; rate of action implementation that does not reflect the rate of change of the ecological system; lack of appropriate indicators for monitoring activities; and occurrence of ecological change at scales smaller or larger than the scale of implementation or monitoring. Not recognizing and accounting for these challenges when planning for conservation can result in actions that do not address the multiscale nature of conservation problems and that do not achieve conservation objectives. Social networks link organizations and individuals across space and time and determine the scale of conservation actions; thus, an understanding of the social networks associated with conservation planning will help determine the potential for implementing conservation actions at the required scales. Social-network analyses can be used to explore whether these networks constrain or enable key social processes and how multiple scales of action are linked. Results of network analyses can be used to mitigate scale mismatches in assessing, planning, implementing, and monitoring conservation projects.

  abstract = {Peatlands are strategic areas for climate change mitigation because of their matchless carbon stocks. Drained peatlands release this carbon to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (CO\textsubscript{2}). Peatland rewetting effectively stops these CO\textsubscript{2} emissions, but also re-establishes the emission of methane (CH\textsubscript{4}). Essentially, management must choose between CO\textsubscript{2} emissions from drained, or CH\textsubscript{4} emissions from rewetted, peatland. This choice must consider radiative effects and atmospheric lifetimes of both gases, with CO\textsubscript{2} being a weak but persistent, and CH\textsubscript{4} a strong but short-lived, greenhouse gas. The resulting climatic effects are, thus, strongly time-dependent. We used a radiative forcing model to compare forcing dynamics of global scenarios for future peatland management using areal data from the Global Peatland Database. Our results show that CH\textsubscript{4} radiative forcing does not undermine the climate change mitigation potential of peatland rewetting. Instead, postponing rewetting increases the long-term warming effect through continued CO\textsubscript{2} emissions.},

  abstract = {Establishing a universal watershed-scale erosion and sediment yield prediction model represents a frontier field in erosion and soil/water conservation. The research presented here was conducted on the Chabagou watershed, which is located in the first sub-region of the hill-gully area of the Loess Plateau, China. A back-propagation artificial neural model for watershed-scale erosion and sediment yield was established, with the accuracy of the model, then compared with that of multiple linear regression. The sensitivity degree of various factors to erosion and sediment yield was quantitatively analysed using the default factor test. On the basis of the sensitive factors and the fractal information dimension, the piecewise prediction model for erosion and sediment yield of individual rainfall events was established and further verified. The results revealed the back-propagation artificial neural network model to perform better than the multiple linear regression model in terms of predicting the erosion modulus, with the former able to effectively characterize dynamic changes in sediment yield under comprehensive factor conditions. The sensitivity of runoff erosion power and runoff depth to the erosion and sediment yield associated with individual rainfall events was found to be related to the complexity of surface topography. The characteristics of such a hydrological response are thus closely related to topography. When the fractal information dimension is greater than the topographic threshold, the accuracy of prediction using runoff erosion power is higher than that of using runoff depth. In contrast, when the fractal information dimension is smaller than the topographic threshold, the accuracy of prediction using runoff depth is higher than that of using runoff erosion power. The developed piecewise prediction model for watershed-scale erosion and sediment yield of individual rainfall events, which introduces runoff erosion power and runoff depth using the fractal information dimension as a boundary, can be considered feasible and reliable and has a high prediction accuracy.

However, currently, field measurements of compound erosion are rarely reported, probably due to the lack of generally accepted wind erosion measurement methods. In this study, an agricultural field at the northern end of the Loess Plateau was selected to measure the compound erosion from 2012 to 2014, in which water erosion was measured by runoff plots, while wind erosion was measured using BSNE samplers. The results indicated that: 1) annual water erosion ranged from 8.1 to 89.4 t ha(-1) a(-1) with a mean of 43.8 t ha(-1) a(-1), while wind erosion ranged from 0.82 to 2.12 t ha(-1) a(-1) with a mean of 1.58 t ha(-1) a(-1); 2) water erosion primarily occurred in the summer, while wind erosion occurred in the spring, and substantial variability was revealed on both the interannual and intra-annual scales for both erosion processes; 3) the compound erosion was temporally alternated and spatially overlaid in the selected field, and wind erosion only accounted for 3\% of the compound erosion. Although water erosion greatly exceeded wind erosion for the selected agricultural field, the need for measuring and monitoring over a longer period to cover the natural variability of weather conditions is highlighted. The relative magnitude of water versus wind erosion was quantified, but more relevant studies are needed, since these studies usually have important implications for future studies and soil conservation practices.},

Results show that there exist frequent fluctuations from high to low water flow in the 51-year period. In general, the discharge has shown a declining trend in the 51 years especially since the 1990s. The annual distribution shows one peak which, year on year is getting smaller. (1) Precipitation has a significant and sustained influence on discharge. (2) A sharp rise of temperature resulted in the increase of evaporation and the decrease of discharge, which has a greater effect than on ice-snow melting. (3) Frozen ground tends to be degraded markedly. There is a significant positive correlation between the permafrost thickness and the discharge. (4) Evaporation rates are significantly increasing, leading to the decrease of discharge. 70\% of the discharge reduction resulted from climate change, and the remaining 30\% may have been caused by human activities.},

  abstract = {Severe soil erosion in the Loess Plateau region and associated large sediment discharge downstream in China have been of great concern for years. A physically based distributed model, the Digital Yellow River model (DYRIM), was developed in 2007 for land management at the basin scale in this region. In DYRIM, an explicit sediment yield equation was derived based on simple assumptions where sediment discharge would increase nonlinearly with the slope length, leading to unrealistic results as the spatial scale increases. The 01_manuscript aims of this study were to reformulate the module of DYRIM in comparison with other process-based erosion models; to develop a generic framework for erosion prediction and simulation of erosion and sediment delivery processes within storm events; to validate the new hillslope erosion module for improved performance across a range of spatial scales; and to evaluate parameter consistency among different runoff events. Observed flow and sediment discharge data for 16 runoff events and three runoff plots with different slope lengths (20, 40, and 60m) for each runoff event from the Tuanshangou experimental site in the Loess Plateau region were used to calibrate the new module for a 20m slope and the calibrated parameter values were then used to predict the sediment discharge for slope lengths of 40 and 60m at the same site. For calibration, the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSE) was 0.92 on average for the 20m plot. For prediction, the average NSE values were 0.87 for 40m plot and 0.90 for the 60m plot. There is a marked improvement over the existing module, for prediction with the existing module, the average NSE values were only -0.86 for the 40m plot and -6.3 for the 60m plot. Whereas the calibrated parameter values vary from event to event, results show that using a common set of parameter values for all runoff events to predict sediment discharge, the overall NSE values using the combined data set are as high as 0.89 for the 40m plot and 0.90 for the 60m plot. This research shows that it is absolutely imperative to include a control term involving the sediment transport capacity, even for the highly erodible region of the Loess Plateau in China.},

Quantifying the impact of climate change, coal mining and soil and water conservation (SWC), which are mainly human activities, on streamflow is essential not only for understanding the mechanism of hydrological response, but also for water resource management in the catchment. In this study, the trend of annual streamflow series by Mann-Kendall test has been analyzed, and years showing abrupt changes have been detected using the cumulative anomaly curves and Pettitt test. The contribution of climate change, coal mining and SWC on streamflow has been separated with the monthly water-balance model (MWBM) and field investigation. The results showed: (1) The streamflow had an statistically significant downward trend during 1955-2013; (2) The two break points were in 1979 and 1996; (3) Relative to the baseline period, i.e., 1955-1978, the mean annual streamflow reduction in 1979-1996 was mainly affected by climate change, which was responsible for a decreased annual streamflow of 12.70 mm, for 70.95\%, while coal mining and SWC resulted in a runoff reduction of 2.15 mm, 12.01\% and 3.05mm, 17.04\%, respectively; (4) In a recent period, i.e., 1997-2013, the impact of coal mining on streamflow reduction was dominant, reaching 29.88 mm, 54.24\%. At the same time, the declining mean annual streamflow induced through climate change and SWC were 13.01 mm, 23.62\% and 12.20 mm, 22.14\%, respectively.},

In this study, empirical algorithms were established to infer sea surface salinity and turbidity of YR plume using on surface reflectance products of MODIS and GOCI satellites in combination with observations from hydrographic surveys during the 2014 WSR event. Inter- and intraday variability of salinity and turbidity were quantitatively assessed and correlated with external forces including river discharge, tides, Coriolis force, and wind-driven circulation. The results revealed the enhanced offshore extension of turbid plume as WSR drastically increased freshwater and sediment discharge to river mouth. During WSR event, the area of low salinity plume ( {$<$} 25 psu) increased to 267 km(2), while sediment plume (SR645 {$>$} 0.12sr(-1)) occupied a maximum area of 162 lung. Intraday variation observed from geostationary GOCI data clearly illustrated the dominance of tidal current on short term dispersal pattern of freshwater and sediment plume. In comparison, wind field dominated the seasonal variation in flume transport but had insignificant impact on short term river plume dynamic during WSR. Overall, this study demonstrated that the spatial and temporal dynamic of YR plume was successfully captured by satellite remote sensing, which provided an effective tool for evaluating the environmental and ecological impact of WSRs.},

  abstract = {Groundwater represents 97\% of the world's available freshwater resources and is extensively abstracted throughout the  world. While abundant in a global context, it can only de developed to a certain extent without causing environmental  impacts. Also, it is highly variable across the globe, and where it is heavily relied on, it is less renewable. Hence, it is  critically important that this resource is managed sustainably. However, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of  the 2030 Development Agenda do not, as a rule, account explicitly for the significant role that groundwater plays and  will continue to play in sustainable development. This report aims to unpack and highlight this role through consistent  analysis of the interlinkages between groundwater and the targets of the SDGs.  The key features of groundwater relevant to the SDGs are its use, management and sustainability. The methodology  used to analyse groundwater interlinkages with SDG targets includes, first, identification of `evidence-based' and  `logical' interlinkages. The first type of interlinkages is supported by existing data, while the second is by information  and logic that needs to be drawn from existing bodies of relevant research. While only a few interlinkages may be  seen at present as ``evidence-based'', more data are continuously emerging to make more interlinkages supported  by hard-core evidence.  Subsequently, the interlinkages are classified into either `reinforcing', `conflicting' or `mixed' - depending on whether  achievement of a target will have predominantly positive, negative, or mixed impact on groundwater. The interlinkages  are also classified into `primary' and `secondary', depending on how strong and direct the impacts on groundwater  from achieving the targets may be. The report presents a summary of key interlinkages, and subsequently provides  the narrative of all `primary' ones.  The analysis suggests that more than half of interlinkages are `reinforcing', while only a few are `conflicting'. From a  policy perspective i) conflicting interlinkages are the most critical and difficult ones to manage, and ii) it is important  to draw synergies between SDG initiatives and groundwater to allow reinforcing interlinkages to materialise. Nearly  a third of all identified interlinkages were classified as `mixed'.  This means that when target activities are planned,  careful consideration must be given to possible impacts on groundwater to avoid unintended negative outcomes  that may not be evident at first. Primary interlinkages that constitute 43\% of all may be the easiest to understand and  the most important to plan for. However, there are even more secondary interlinkages. This means that groundwater  experts need to be able to share knowledge to a range of actors involved in addressing the targets with secondary  interlinkages to groundwater, and vice versa.  It  is  also  shown  that  i)  the  importance  of  groundwater  to  sustainable  development  is  poorly  recognised  and  captured at the SDG target level; ii) there is a lack of globally useful, up-to-date and SDG-relevant groundwater data  available, which makes it difficult to make globally, and even locally, relevant recommendations for groundwater use,  management and sustainability in the SDG era, and iii) there are often poor links between targets and their indicators.  This may signal that all groundwater-related and groundwater-relevant aspirations may not be translated into real, let  alone, measurable action. This report is not a comprehensive analysis and involves an element of subjectivity, associated primarily with the  data and information paucity on one hand, and with the imperfection of the SDG target and indicator system itself  \textendash{} on another. However, even with these limitations, the report shows how significant groundwater is in sustainable  development, even if the current SDG framework is implicit about this. Furthermore, it suggests a structured way to  improve the visibility of groundwater in the SDG framework as it continues to develop.},

  abstract = {A new paradigm for planning under conditions of deep uncertainty has emerged in the literature. According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called 'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways'. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans: 'Adaptive Policymaking' and 'Adaptation Pathways'. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. 'mitigating actions' and 'hedging actions') and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political, technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test and use the approach. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Yet, development interventions continue to prioritise economic development and short-term goals with little consideration of social-ecological interdependencies, ultimately undermining resilience and therefore efforts to deliver development outcomes. We propose and advance a coevolutionary perspective for rethinking development and its relationship to resilience. The perspective rests on three propositions: (1) social-ecological relationships coevolve through processes of variation, selection and retention, which are manifest in practices; (2) resilience is the capacity to filter practices (i.e. to influence what is selected and retained); and (3) development is a coevolutionary process shaping pathways of persistence, adaptation or transformation. Development interventions affect and are affected by social\textendash ecological relationships and their coevolutionary dynamics, with consequences for resilience, often with perverse outcomes. A coevolutionary approach enables development interventions to better consider social\textendash ecological interdependencies and dynamics. Adopting a coevolutionary perspective, which we illustrate with a case on agricultural biodiversity, encourages a radical rethinking of how resilience and development are conceptualised and practiced across global to local scales.},

We propose four categories for better empirical analysis of climate skepticism: epistemic deniers, epistemic doubters (borrowing from Capstick and Pidgeon 2014), attribution deniers, and attribution doubters (borrowing from Rahmstorf 2004). Using a unique dataset of surveys (n = 1000) and in\- terviews (n = 33) with residents of the U.S. Pacific Northwest who are skeptical about climate change, we compare those four groups across several predictors and demographic variables (age, race, gender, political ideology, religiosity, income, education, and level of trust in science) and outcome variables (environmental concern, policy support, and conspiracy ideation (adherence to the belief that climate change is a ``hoax''). We demonstrate the importance of considering attitudinal uncertainty in the analysis of climate skepticism by providing evidence for the presence of a continuum of thought wherein epistemic deniers and attribution doubters make up the two ends of a continuum with more complicated distinctions between epistemic doubters and attribution deniers.},

This approach builds on the premise that characteristic bundles of ecosystem service use represent integrated expressions of different underlying social\textendash ecological systems. We test the approach in South Africa using national census data on the direct use of six provisioning services (freshwater from a natural source, firewood for cooking, firewood for heating, natural building materials, animal production, and crop production) at two different scales. Based on a cluster analysis, we identify three distinct ecosystem service bundles that represent social\textendash ecological systems characterized by low, medium and high levels of direct ecosystem service use among households. We argue that these correspond to `green-loop', `transition' and `red-loop' systems as defined by Cumming et al. (2014). When mapped, these systems form coherent spatial units that differ from systems identified by additive combinations of separate social and biophysical datasets, the most common method of mapping social\textendash ecological systems to date. The distribution of the systems we identified is mainly determined by social factors, such as household income, gender of the household head, and land tenure, and only partly determined by the supply of natural resources. An understanding of the location and characteristic resource use dynamics of different social\textendash ecological systems allows for policies to be better targeted at the particular sustainability challenges faced in different areas.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Whether it be the passengers' mobility demand in transportation systems, or the consumers' energy demand in power grids, the primary purpose of many infrastructure networks is to best serve this flow demand. In reality, the volume of flow demand fluctuates unevenly across complex networks while simultaneously being hindered by some form of congestion or overload. Nevertheless, there is little known about how the heterogeneity of flow demand influences the network flow dynamics under congestion. To explore this, we introduce a percolation-based network analysis framework underpinned by flow heterogeneity. Thereby, we theoretically identify bottleneck links with guaranteed decisive impact on how flows are passed through the network. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated on large-scale real transportation networks, where mitigating the congestion on a small fraction of the links identified as bottlenecks results in a significant network improvement.},

  abstract = {The interactions between precipitation, runoff and sedimentation could reveal information about the processes of runoff and sediment production and the environmental evolution mechanisms of basins. Based on the hydrometeorological data collected over a long-term time series (1955-2012) which has been divided into five periods (P1 (1956-1969), P2 (1970-1979), P3 (1980-1989), P4 (1990-1999) and P5 (2000-2012)), changes and implications of the relationships between precipitation, runoff and sediment load (precipitation-runoff-sediment relationships) were studied in the Wuding River basin, China. Conclusions are as follows. (1) There is no obvious change occurs on the distribution of annual precipitation during 1955 to 2012. However, the annual runoff and sediment load are significantly decreased by 51.9\% and 86.4\%, respectively, from P1 to P5. (2) Under the same precipitation conditions, the runoff and sediment present overall decreasing trends. Decrease in the runoff was greater than that in the sediment load. The incoming sediment coefficient (ISC) reduced by 69.2\%, indicating that the sediment transport ability per unit runoff was weakened. The significant reduction of ISC along with the decrease of the runoff amount caused the sediment brought into the Yellow River (STWY) decreased from P1 to P5. (3) Soil conservation measures played a critical role for the changes in precipitation-runoff-sediment relationships. Due to the rapid increases in the available storage of check dams in P2 and P5 and the areas of forest and grassland in P2, relationships among the precipitation, runoff and sediment has drastically changed. Decrease of the effects on sediment interception in check dams caused the sediment increased from P3 to P4. (4) Decreases of runoff and sediment load, and changes in their relationships would continue with the sustainable management of slopes and gullies. The potentially detrimental changes in the storage of check dams and those in runoff and sediment influenced by extreme weather conditions should be monitored and managed.},

Here we introduce two data products, the Forest Structural Condition Index (SCI) and the Forest Structural Integrity Index (FSII), to meet this need for the humid tropics. The SCI integrates canopy height, tree cover, and time since disturbance to distinguish short, open-canopy, or recently deforested stands from tall, closed-canopy, older stands typical of primary forest. The SCI was validated against estimates of foliage height diversity derived from airborne lidar. The FSII overlays a global index of human pressure on SCI to identify structurally complex forests with low human pressure, likely the most valuable for maintaining biodiversity and ecosystem services. These products represent an important step in maturation from conservation focus on forest extent to forest stands that should be considered ``best of the last'' in international policy settings.},

(p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains. Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil's well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change. Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012.

  abstract = {Tropical forests vary in composition, structure and function such that not all forests have similar ecological value. This variability is caused by natural and anthropogenic disturbance regimes, which influence the ability of forests to support biodiversity, store carbon, mediate water yield and facilitate human well-being. While international environmental agreements mandate protecting and restoring forests, only forest extent is typically considered, while forest quality is ignored. Consequently, the locations and loss rates of forests of high ecological value are unknown and coordinated strategies for conserving these forests remain undeveloped. Here, we map locations high in forest structural integrity as a measure of ecological quality on the basis of recently developed fine-resolution maps of three-dimensional forest structure, integrated with human pressure across the global moist tropics. Our analyses reveal that tall forests with closed canopies and low human pressure typical of natural conditions comprise half of the global humid or moist tropical forest estate, largely limited to the Amazon and Congo basins. Most of these forests have no formal protection and, given recent rates of loss, are at substantial risk. With the rapid disappearance of these `best of the last' forests at stake, we provide a policy-driven framework for their conservation and restoration, and recommend locations to maintain protections, add new protections, mitigate deleterious human impacts and restore forest structure.},

  abstract = {Considering the influence of river discharge and strong winds, the diurnal variability of ocean optical absorption properties in the Yellow River Estuary (YRE) is quantified, using in-situ measurements. The study finds that terrestrial sources due to the Yellow River discharge can cause high diurnal variation of water absorption because of the movement of river plume in the YRE, but such an influence diminishes far away from the Yellow River plume. The diurnal variability of water absorption, affected by strong winds, is found to be strengthened with a rapid increase of particles and colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) arising from re-suspended sediment induced by wave forcing. The diurnal variability of particle absorption is controlled by non-algal particle absorption in the YRE, and the ratio of non-algal particle absorption (aNAP) and total particle absorption for most wavelengths is more than 0.56. The diurnal variation of spectral slope of non-algal particle absorption (SNAP) is found to vary within a narrow range, although large variability in the aNAP spectrum is observed. The CDOM is correlated negatively with salinity, and such negative correlation becomes weaker with the decreasing influence of riverine input. The spectral slope of CDOM absorption (Sg) may reflect the formation and constituents of CDOM with weak relationship to its concentration, and its relationship with the absorption of CDOM at 440 nm may be associated with the source of CDOM. The value of Sg, which is affected by re-suspended bottom sediment, is much lower than that derived from CDOM affected by Yellow River runoff. Disregarding the absorption of pure water, the diurnal variability of total water absorption stems principally from changes in non-algal particle matter rather than CDOM and Chl-a. By the observations of hourly GOCI (Geostationary Ocean Color Imager) data, the major diurnal variations of remote sensing reflectance at 680 nm are observed in near-coastal waters and the estuary of the Yellow River, which are mainly influenced by the flow discharge of Yellow River and strong winds. Finally, the seasonal differences of diurnal variations of water absorption caused by strong winds and river discharge are determined.},

This situation also created a dynamic landscape and a variety of cultural responses depending on the specific cultural-historical circumstances. The aggradation of the floodplain has also influenced the recovery of archaeological remains. Predynastic settlement sites in the Delta are 4-6m below the surface and Graeco-Roman settlements are 1-2m deep.

A wealth of studies have assessed biotic responses to urbanization in North America and Europe, but there is little empirical evidence that directly links human activities to urban biodiversity in the tropics. Results from a large-scale field study conducted in Nairobi, Kenya, are used to explore the impact of human activities on the biodiversity of wildlife and livestock with which humans co-exist across the city. The structure of sympatric wildlife, livestock and human populations are characterized using unsupervised machine learning, and statistical modelling is used to relate compositional variation in these communities to socio-ecological drivers occurring across the city. By characterizing landscape-scale drivers acting on these interfaces, we demonstrate that socioeconomics, elevation and subsequent changes in habitat have measurable impacts upon the diversity, density and species assemblage of wildlife, livestock and humans. Restructuring of wildlife and livestock assemblages (both in terms of species diversity and composition) has important implications for the emergence of novel diseases at urban interfaces, and we therefore use our results to generate a set of testable hypotheses that explore the influence of urban change on microbial communities. These results provide novel insight into the impact of urbanization on biodiversity in the tropics. An understanding of associations between urban processes and the structure of human and animal populations is required to link urban development to conservation efforts and risks posed by disease emergence to human health, ultimately informing sustainable urban development policy.},

  abstract = {Cooperative investments in social dilemmas can spontaneously diversify into stably coexisting high and low contributors in well-mixed populations. Here we extend the analysis to emerging diversity in (spatially) structured populations. Using pair approximation, we derive analytical expressions for the invasion fitness of rare mutants in structured populations, which then yields a spatial adaptive dynamics framework. This allows us to predict changes arising from population structures in terms of existence and location of singular strategies, as well as their convergence and evolutionary stability as compared to well-mixed populations. Based on spatial adaptive dynamics and extensive individual-based simulations, we find that spatial structure has significant and varied impacts on evolutionary diversification in continuous social dilemmas. More specifically, spatial adaptive dynamics suggests that spontaneous diversification through evolutionary branching is suppressed, but simulations show that spatial dimensions offer new modes of diversification that are driven by an interplay of finite-size mutations and population structures. Even though spatial adaptive dynamics is unable to capture these new modes, they can still be understood based on an invasion analysis. In particular, population structures alter invasion fitness and can open up new regions in trait space where mutants can invade, but that may not be accessible to small mutational steps. Instead, stochastically appearing larger mutations or sequences of smaller mutations in a particular direction are required to bridge regions of unfavorable traits. The net effect is that spatial structure tends to promote diversification, especially when selection is strong.},

These challenges, or policy issues, nonetheless exhibit interdependencies that may constrain the ability of actors to work together towards joint solutions. Still, we have limited knowledge about whether and how policy issue interdependencies actually shape how actors collaborate. Using data derived from two venues for collaborative water governance in the Norrstr\"om basin, Sweden, we investigate whether and how policy issues and policy issue interdependencies influence actors' selection of collaborative partners. We test two alternative sets of propositions; one set assumes that partner selection is driven by actors' engagement in policy issues and their interdependencies, while the other set emphasises social positions and actor attributes. Our results show that in one venue, actors' choices of collaborative partner were associated with factors from both sets, but not with policy issue interdependencies specifically. In the other venue, only actor and relational attributes shaped social tie formation. These results suggest that how actors interact does not necessarily align with the policy issues and the policy issue interdependencies defined by the environmental problem they are to address. Our results provide an important step towards arriving at evidence-based recommendations for more effective collaborative efforts in addressing complex environmental problems that no actor can address alone.

The ratios between deposition in XBGL and change of runoff and sediment by human activities in the upper drainage area were 0 in 1971-1984, 0.15 in 1985-1998, and -0.39 in 1999-2012. For the changed deposition processes of the XBGL, the ratios between deposition in the LYR and change of runoff and sediment by human activities in the upper drainage area were 0.87 in 1971-1984, 0.92 in 1985-1998, and 2.33 in 1999-2012. The analyses revealed the important role of XBGL in sediment storage in the river system, where the decrease in inflow suspended sediment load of XBGL results in a likely increase in the outflow of the river reach.},

The food quality and location decisions are deemed to be the two principal considerations of restaurants in this emerging market. To investigate the evolutionary food quality and location behaviours of restaurants, we propose an agent-based O2O food ordering model (AOFOM) that consists of three types of agents, namely customers, restaurants, and the online food ordering platform. We explicitly model their adaptive behaviours by optimizing the agents' benefits. We find that customers' behaviours have significant impacts on the restaurants' food quality decisions. Besides, the relationship between the restaurant's location decisions and customers' waiting time is less significant in the O2O food ordering market due to the presence of an equalizing delivery service provided by the online platform. We also examine the characters of best restaurants, as well as the impacts of different delivery policies on the food quality and location decisions of restaurants.},

With high-resolution sedimentary core samples and organic-inorganic geochemical methods, we reconstruct the past similar to 150-year ecosystem evolution of Lake Wuliangsu in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, and probe factors controlling the ecological dynamics. In this study, ecological changes in Lake Wuliangsu over the past similar to 150years were identified. After the lake formed in the 1850s, biological productivity of the lake was still under-developed until the 1950s. During the period of 1950s-1970s, submerged macrophytes became the dominant organisms in the lake because of lake area expansion and slight increases of nutrient input from agricultural development in the catchment. The domination of submerged macrophytes ceased after the 1970s, which was possibly induced by the shrinkage of the lake area. After the 1990s, the 01_manuscript contributor of sedimentary n-alkanes most likely shifted to reeds because of eutrophication caused by anthropogenic activities. The results clearly demonstrate that the ecosystem in Lake Wuliangsu before the 1950s strongly depended on the natural discharge, whereas at later stages, it was significantly influenced by human activities. During the period of 1950s-1990s, the human-monitored lake area seems to be the 01_manuscript factor in the lake ecosystem evolution. However, when the nutrient supply went beyond the tipping point after the 1990s, eutrophication took over and played a key role in the lake ecosystem evolution.},

The Yellow River in the North of China is one of the biggest rivers of the world, but the riparian wetland area is very small.

We use remote sensing and hydrologic data to analyze the change of wetland vegetation in the Zhengzhou natural reserve, which is affected by a rapid population growth and change of water flow. The 01_manuscript findings are: (1) the vegetation cover of the study area decreased from 1984 to 2011, (2) the hydrologic boundary conditions changed dramatically after the construction of a dam upstream and floods have almost disappeared under the new water resource management, (3) there is a conflict between the protection of the wetland vegetation and its use for recreation and tourism. Actually, anthropogenic factors are the 01_manuscript reasons for wetland degradation, and the government and the water management department should pay more attention to the protection of the remaining wetlands and the environmental balance.},

Overcoming these challenges requires balancing trade-offs between sectors and improving resilience to drought impacts. An under-appreciated factor in managing the water-food-energy (WFE) nexus is the increased value of solar and wind energy (SWE). Here we develop a trade-off frontier framework to quantify the water sustainability value of SWE through a case study in California. We identify development pathways that optimize the economic value of water in competition for energy and food production while ensuring sustainable use of groundwater. Our results indicate that in the long term, SWE penetration creates beneficial feedback for the WFE nexus: SWE enhances drought resilience and benefits groundwater sustainability, and in turn, maintaining groundwater at a sustainable level increases the added value of SWE to energy and food production.},

  abstract = {The Limburg Soil Erosion Model (LISEM) soil erosion model was calibrated for a 2-km(2) catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau. The most important calibration factors were saturated conductivity and Manning's n. Calibration on catchment discharge was done by using the discharge peak (timing and discharge) followed by an adjustment for the total discharge to obtain the correct amount of sediment output. The results showed that LISEM can be successfully calibrated for a Loess Plateau catchment, and that small runoff events need to be calibrated separately from large runoff events. A separate calibration might even be needed for each event. The model performance was also evaluated using catchment wide spatially distributed data on rill erosion. Rill erosion intensity was mapped in the field and compared to spatial patterns of erosion predicted by LISEM. The simulated erosion patterns do show some resemblance with mapped erosion patterns in a general sense but they are very different in detail. The cause for this can be found in the extremely steep slopes and abrupt slope changes in the catchment. Some of the process descriptions in LISEM are not intended for such an environment, while the grid based kinematic wave routing cannot cope with the abrupt changes in flow conditions. The effects of this are amplified by inaccuracies in the input data and the DEM. For topographically complex catchments it will be very difficult to obtain data that are good enough for an accurate simulation of erosion patterns. This limits the use of a model such as LISEM as a predictive tool for future events. Simulation of different land use scenarios is less problematic, if a known event is used for all scenario simulations. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Several land use scenarios were developed for the 3.5 km(2) Danangou catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau. These scenarios consist of four groups of three scenarios each: one group is based on the present land use distribution, the other three (alternative land uses) on a redistribution of land use according to slope gradient, soil type, slope aspect and land form. For example, cropland areas are restricted to slope gradients smaller than 25\%, 20\% and 15\%. All groups consist of one scenario that only uses present or alternative land use and two scenarios that apply simple forms of biological conservation practices (mulching, improved fallow) and mechanical conservation practices (contour ridges). The LISEM soil erosion model was used to simulate the effects of these different scenarios on erosion. To do this, a calibrated Lisem-data set for a real storm was used. The results show that the predicted erosion rates for woodland/shrubland are much lower than those for other land uses. According to the simulations, runoff. and erosion decrease by about 10\% if conservation measures are applied to the present land use, while the predicted decrease for the alternative land uses is much larger at between 40\% and 60\%. This large decrease can be explained by the fact that one of the 01_manuscript differences in the alternative land uses is that they have much more woodland/shrubland. Differences in predicted erosion rates between the different alternative land uses are caused by conversion of cropland to orchard/cash tree. The present study is one of the first attempts to use soil erosion modelling as a tool for optimising land use and management strategies to reduce runoff and erosion rates on the Chinese Loess Plateau. More research will be needed to validate obtained simulation results with actual field measurements. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The annual runoff of which is only about 2 \% of China's total, but contributes to 9 \% of China's GDP and directly supports 12 \% of the population. Today, the water shortage in the Yellow River basin has been aggravated due to rapid population growth and global warming. In order to best maximize water resources management, the natural and observed streamflow series from six hydrologic gauging stations (Guide, Lanzhou, Hekou, Sanmenxia, Huayuankou, and Lijin) are obtained, and the linear regression, Mann-Kendall test, and wavelet transform methods were used to detect the characteristic of streamflow variation from 1956 to 2007. The results show that: (1) both the natural streamflow and observed streamflow present a downward trend over the past 52 years, and the trends are intensified downstream; the decreasing rate of observed streamflow is more rapid than that of the natural streamflow; (2) most of the abrupt changes in natural streamflow and observed streamflow appear in the late 1980s to early 1990s through the result of the Mann-Kendall test; and (3) other than the Guide station, the streamflows at the rest of the stations appear to have strongest periodicity of 19-21 years with a 52-year scale. The results of this study imply that less precipitation and warmer climate in the basin are the primary factors that cause this decreasing trend of natural streamflow. Additionally, the rapid ascent of water consumption by human being results in the reduction of observed streamflow further. Furthermore, human activities like reservoir construction, soil and water conservation measures, etc. influence the streamflow as well. It is recommended that the society takes some effective countermeasures to cope with the water shortage.},

Because water quality readings are important for political evaluations and the monitoring stations only capture emissions from their upstream regions, local government officials are incentivized to enforce tighter environmental standards on firms immediately upstream of a monitoring station, rather than those immediately downstream. Exploiting this discontinuity in regulation stringency with novel firm-level geocoded emission and production data sets, we find that immediate upstream polluters face a more than 24\% reduction in total factor productivity (TFP), and a more than 57\% reduction in chemical oxygen demand emissions, as compared with their immediate downstream counterparts. We find that the discontinuity in TFP does not exist in nonpolluting industries, only emerged after the government explicitly linked political promotion to water quality readings, and was predominantly driven by prefectural cities with career-driven leaders. Linking the TFP estimate with the emission estimate, a back-of-the-envelope calculation indicates that China's water regulation efforts between 2000 and 2007 were associated with an economic cost of more than 800 billion Chinese yuan.},

As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

Here, we study this network of relatedness between products, or ``product space,'' finding that more-sophisticated products are located in a densely connected core whereas less-sophisticated products occupy a less-connected periphery. Empirically, countries move through the product space by developing goods close to those they currently produce. Most countries can reach the core only by traversing empirically infrequent distances, which may help explain why poor countries have trouble developing more competitive exports and fail to converge to the income levels of rich countries. Network analysis of the products made by rich and poor countries show that movement toward higher-profit products may be restricted for much of the developing world.

Our aim is to identify archetypes of sustainability transformation research derived for sustainability science and social-ecological systems research that make knowledge from the two research pathways more accessible to each other in order to foster transformation. To reach this goal, we applied a mixed method approach toward an archetype analysis, based on semantic networks and clusters. Our findings point out that the fields of sustainability science and social-ecological systems research are rather coherent and not so distinct as may be expected, especially in terms of normative goals and addressed topics. Our analysis inductively reveals four archetypes of sustainability transformation research, with thematic structures clustered around (1) environmental change and ecosystem services; (2) resilience and vulnerability; (3) knowledge production for sustainability; and (4) governance for sustainability. We describe how these archetypes interact and facilitate dialogue between the fields. When considering the two transformation research pathways from the perspective of the research mode of transdisciplinary research, their discourses appear more disconnected. To fill this gap, we uncover key concepts that can strengthen the connection of the two fields to inform and foster sustainability transformations. These concepts involve engaging with nonacademic actors and seeking impact in policy.},

In particular, clearance of the brain without membrane damage is required for the imaging of lipophilic tracer-labeled neural tracts. Relying on an ascending gradient of fructose solutions, SeeDB can achieve sufficient transparency of the mouse brain while ensuring that the plasma membrane remains intact. However, it is challenging to extend this method to larger mammalian brains due to the extremely high viscosity of the saturated fructose solution. Here we report a SeeDB-derived optical clearing method, termed FRUIT which utilizes a cocktail of fructose and urea. As demonstrated in the adult mouse brain, combination of these two highly water-soluble clearing agents exerts a synergistic effect on clearance. More importantly, the final FRUIT solution has low viscosity so as to produce transparency of the whole adult rabbit brain via arterial perfusion, which is impossible to achieve with a saturated fructose solution. In addition to good compatibility with enhanced yellow fluorescent protein, the cocktail also preserves the fluorescence of the lipophilic tracer Dil. This work provides a volume-independent optical clearing method which retains the advantages of SeeDB, particularly compatibility with lipophilic tracers.},

This paper examines the role of the VES concept in measuring trends in human wellbeing. Under conventional arguments from applied welfare economics, standard measures of market consumption may be extended to include the value of direct environmental services, which affect welfare in ways that are not mediated by the consumption of purchased goods. The VES concept does not capture values such as ecological sustainability and distributional fairness that are not reducible to individual welfare. And its operationalization is constrained by the well-known limitations of nonmarket valuation methods. Nonetheless, attempts to calculate the value of environmental services can provide insights into the tradeoffs between market activity and environmental quality that are implicit in the process of economic growth. Such efforts can promote informed debate concerning the achievement of sustainable development. \textcopyright{} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

We presented a forecasting framework for EFs, IFA and EF satisfaction degree to assess suitable EFs (minimum or threshold) and forecast EF satisfaction degree over the next 20 years. First, we investigated the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of IFA using statistical analysis and Morlet wavelet analysis of the hydrologic series from 1919 to 2013. Second, forecasting models of IFA were established using hydrologic stochastic simulation based on wavelet analysis. Then, abrupt shifts of baseflow index (BI) were identified based on Mann-Kendall trend detection test. Subsequently, regressions models were developed between a normalized BI and the effect size (ES) of zoobenthos and fish species richness. Accordingly, EFs were calculated. Finally, the IFA and EF satisfaction degree for the forecasting years were calculated. Results show that thresholds of BI, with 0.8 and 0.4 as the lower limit, and 2.3 and 1.1 as the upper limit, were recommended as the limit percentage of the EFs standard during flood and non-flood seasons, respectively. An overall decreasing tendency of IFA was observed in all the seven stations from the 1910s to 2010s, which is especially particularly significant in the lower reaches in the past two or three decades. One major EFs deficit spell occurred throughout the river beginning in the 1990s. Forecasting results indicate that the IFA will satisfy the EFs for the stations located in the upper and middle reaches by 2020 and 2030, except for the stations in the lower reaches. Contradictions of EFs and IFA will be even graver in the future. The results will have important implications for the water management of the riverine ecosystem. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

High-resolution soil-sedimentary data define an abruptly increased climatic aridity at 3100 a B.P. on the southern Loess Plateau. It was caused by a shift from the dominance of the maritime monsoon to the continental monsoon in the East Asia. The marked aridity induced a considerable deterioration of environment and degradation of land resources. Consequently, both the livestock failure of the nomadic tribes in the north and the crop failure of the Han Chinese in the south resulted in large-scale nomadic southward migration, and dislocations of the political capital and capital cities of the predynastic Zhou culture. Land use of arable farming was replaced largely by pastoral farming on the plateau. The combination of severe drought and resultant great famine was the fundamental cause of social instability and eventual collapse of the Shang Dynasty at 3000 a B.P. This suggests that the impact of abrupt climatic change was profound at 3100 a B.P. in the present semi-arid zone. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

Projecting the areal change in drylands is essential for taking early action to prevent the aggravation of global desertification(3,4). However, dryland expansion has been underestimated in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) simulations(5) considering the past 58 years (1948-2005). Here, using historical data to bias-correct CMIP5 projections, we show an increase in dryland expansion rate resulting in the drylands covering half of the global land surface by the end of this century. Dryland area, projected under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) RCP8.5 and RCP4.5, will increase by 23\% and 11\%, respectively, relative to 1961-1990 baseline, equalling 56\% and 50\%, respectively, of total land surface. Such an expansion of drylands would lead to reduced carbon sequestration and enhanced regional warming(6,7), resulting in warming trends over the present drylands that are double those over humid regions. The increasing aridity, enhanced warming and rapidly growing human population will exacerbate the risk of land degradation and desertification in the near future in the drylands of developing countries, where 78\% of dryland expansion and 50\% of the population growth will occur under RCP8.5.},

The results show that the quantities of soil erosion decreased clearly from 1977 to 2015 in the study area, which from 2011 (t/km(2).a) in 1977 to 164 (t/km(2).a) in 2004 and increased slowly to 320 (t/km(2).a) in 2015. No significant soil erosion ({$<$}300 t/km(2).a) changed in JYG watershed, which increased dramatically from 8.93\% to 69.34\% during 1977-2015. The area of farmland in this study area has been reduced drastically. Noting that the annual average soil erosion modulus of grassland was also showing a dropped trend from 1977 to 2015. In addition, the study shows that the annual average soil erosion modulus varied with slope gradient and the severe soil erosion often existed in the slope zone above 25, which accounted for 4657 (t/km(2).a) in 1977 and 382.27 (t/km(2).a) in 2015. Meanwhile, soil erosion of different land-use types presented the similar changing trend (declined noticeably and then increased slowly) with the change of slope gradient from 1977 to 2015. Combined the investigations of extreme rainfall on 26 July 2015 for JYG watershed, the study provides the scientific support for the implementation of soil and water conservation measures to reduce the soil erosion and simplify Yellow River management procedures.},

Pedogenesis of the Luvisols and Isohumisols was intensified because of the increased monsoonal precipitation and soil moisture. Localized fires in connection with human activities occurred in different patterns at the study sites. Fire seems to have been applied to vegetation clearance for land reclamation for millet cultivation at many places during the Neolithic and early Bronze Age. Levels of biomass burning were very high during the late Holocene, when the climate became drier and historical land-use became more intensive. At some sites, the intensity of human disturbance by fire and cultivation increased continuously during the last 3100 years. At the other sites, local fires occurred most frequently between 3100 years BP and 1500 years BP during the major period of land reclamation for cereal cultivation. Human burning of the landscape has been reduced since then. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Drylands are home to more than 38\% of the world's population and are one of the most sensitive areas to climate change and human activities. This review describes recent progress in dryland climate change research. Recent findings indicate that the long-term trend of the aridity index (AI) is mainly attributable to increased greenhouse gas emissions, while anthropogenic aerosols exert small effects but alter its attributions. Atmosphere-land interactions determine the intensity of regional response. The largest warming during the last 100 years was observed over drylands and accounted for more than half of the continental warming. The global pattern and interdecadal variability of aridity changes are modulated by oceanic oscillations. The different phases of those oceanic oscillations induce significant changes in land-sea and north-south thermal contrasts, which affect the intensity of the westerlies and planetary waves and the blocking frequency, thereby altering global changes in temperature and precipitation. During 1948\textendash 2008, the drylands in the Americas became wetter due to enhanced westerlies, whereas the drylands in the Eastern Hemisphere became drier because of the weakened East Asian summer monsoon. Drylands as defined by the AI have expanded over the last 60 years and are projected to expand in the 21st century. The largest expansion of drylands has occurred in semiarid regions since the early 1960s. Dryland expansion will lead to reduced carbon sequestration and enhanced regional warming. The increasing aridity, enhanced warming, and rapidly growing population will exacerbate the risk of land degradation and desertification in the near future in developing countries.},

  abstract = {A Holocene loess profile to the west of Xi'an China was studied multi-disciplinarily to investigate the relationships between soil erosion and monsoonal climatic change, The proxy data obtained from this aeolian loess and palaeosol sequence indicate large-scale variations of climate in the southern Loess Plateau since the last glaciation. A rainwash bed, indicative of a wetter climate, excessive runoff and erosion on the loess tablelands, was identified relating to the early Holocene before the onset of the "climatic optimum". This is synchronous with the early Holocene physiographic erosional stage identified in the valleys in North China. It means that severe erosion took place when the region was undergoing climatic amelioration during the early Holocene. The evidence presented in this paper shows that the erosion occurred as a regional response to a monsoonal climatic shift in the southern Loess Plateau. During the last glaciation, prior to the erosion phase, the land surface on the tablelands had been largely stable except for the rapid accumulation of aeolian dust and the resultant increase in its elevation. Relatively slow dust accumulation and intensive bio-pedogenesis responding to the Holocene "climatic optimum" followed the erosion phase. The loess tablelands were most vulnerable to erosion during the large-scale monsoonal climatic shift from dry-cold glacial to humid-warm post-glacial conditions in the southern Loess Plateau.

  abstract = {Holocene palaeohydrological investigations were carried out in the middle reach of the jinghe River that drains the central part of the Loess Plateau. A set of palaeoflood slackwater deposits was found interbedded in the Holocene loess-soil sequence within the cliff riverbanks. Both the sedimentary criteria and the analytical results show that this sediment was sourced from a suspended sediment load of floodwater. The major cultural layer of a late Neolithic settlement (4300-4000 a BP) occurring at the same site is blanketed by this flood deposit directly. Slopewash with pottery shards, charcoal and burnt earth occurs in between the palaeoflood slackwater deposit beds. It indicates that each of the slackwater deposit beds has recorded one individual flood event, and that these extraordinary floods occurred when the late Neolithic people occupied the riverbank terrace land. This pre-historical settlement was abandoned after the floods eventually due presumably to repeated inundation by overbank floodwater. The flood events were OSL dated to between 4100 and 4000 a BP and checked by archaeological dating of the anthropogenic remains retrieved from the sequences. Peak discharges of the floods were estimated to between 19,500 and 22,000 m(3) s(-1), which is several times gauged maximum floods. During the 4200-4000 a BP climatic event, severe droughts were documented in China's monsoonal regions and great floods were known from an ancient legend. This study provides a well-dated sediment record of pre-historical floods which occurred at the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age in the Yellow River basin. It shows that extraordinary floods were part of the abrupt climatic variability during the 4200-4000 a BP climatic event. The highly variable, unstable and catastrophic climate typified by both droughts and floods resulted in settlement abandonment, and possibly the decline of the highly developed late Neolithic civilizations in China's monsoonal regions.

Several bedsets of flood slackwater deposit were identified in the Holocene loess-soil sequences on the riverbanks. They were differentiated from aeolian loess and soils by the parallel and waving beddings and the distinctive stratigraphic breaks separating individual palaeoflood events. Chronology of the flood events was established by OSL dating, checked by archaeological identification of the anthropogenic remains retrieved from the sequences. The results show that successive floods occurred between 4300 and 4000 a BP in association with the abrupt climatic event of 4200 a BP. These overbank floods had the riverbank settlement inundated repeatedly. Another series of extraordinary floods occurred between 3200 and 3000 a BP when monsoonal climate shifted from the mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum toward late Holocene dry conditions. The climatic event of 4200 a BP and the climatic decline at 3100 a BP were believed to be characterized by droughts previously. This work provides solid evidence that both severe droughts and extreme floods were parts of the climatic variability during abrupt climatic event and climatic decline in the semi-arid to sub-humid zones over the world.

The results reveal that the largest expansion of drylands has occurred in semi-arid regions since the early 1960s. This expansion of semi-arid regions accounts for more than half of the total dryland expansion. The area of semi-arid regions in the most recent 15 years studied (1990-2004) is 7 \% larger than that during the first 15 years (1948-1962) of the study period; this expansion totaled 0.4 x 10(6) and 1.2 x 10(6) km(2) within the American continents and in the Eastern Hemisphere, respectively. Although semi-arid expansion occurred in both regions, the shifting patterns of the expansion are different. Across the American continents, the newly formed semi-arid regions developed from arid regions, in which the climate became wetter. Conversely, in the continental Eastern Hemisphere, semi-arid regions replaced sub-humid/humid regions, in which the climate became drier. The climate change in drying semi-arid regions over East Asia is primarily dominated by a weakened East Asian summer monsoon, while the wetting of semi-arid regions over North America is primarily controlled by enhanced westerlies.},

  abstract = {Chinese loess deposits are generally considered to be the product of dust storms and dust falls from the central Asia and zones that were transported across China by the northwesterly continental monsoon. In contrast, the Zhengzhou Loess found southeast of the Loess Plateau, adjacent to the floodplain of the Yellow River, records a different eolian regime and dust source. The Zhengzhou Loess was investigated by field observations, measurements of magnetic susceptibility, particle-size distribution, loss-on-ignition, CaCO3 and chemical contents. Both field observations and the laboratory results indicate that, during the last glacial, the Zhengzhou Loess was supplied by two different eolian regimes and dust sources, one was from the fresh flood deposits of the Yellow River driven by the northeast winds from the low-lying floodplain, and the other was from the dust storms and dust falls that traveled across the Loess Plateau driven by the northwesterly continental monsoon from the central Asian and lands. The early Holocene, 11,500-8500 a BP, was a transition during the change in eolian regime and dust source because of the weakened northwesterly monsoon along with the global climatic amelioration. Following the retreat of the northwesterly monsoon from the onset of the mid-Holocene Climatic Optimum at 8500 a BP, dust supply from the drifting sand zone on the Yellow River floodplain became dominant because of the intensified strength of the northeast winds from the Bohai Sea. From 3100 a BP onwards, climatic aridity and extensive human disturbance have resulted in intensive eolian processes causing the incursion of the drifting sand into the Zhengzhou Loess zone. These results show that loess accumulation is more complex than traditionally assumed. The origin of loess deposits elsewhere outside the Loess Plateau may be related to dust sources derived from alluvial sediments of major river systems. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

At the same time, environmental deterioration, soil erosion, land desertification, shrinkage of wetlands and lakes, glacier ablation, deterioration of grasslands, rodent infestation, degradation of biological diversity and other environmental and ecological problems have arisen. As a result, the regional hydro-ecological system has become more and more vulnerable. Although the mean annual temperature in the region has increased by about 1.5 degrees C since the 1960s, the average annual precipitation since 2004 has exceeded the long-term average value, and the run-off at all hydrological sections on the 01_manuscript stream of the Yellow River has increased continuously since 2008, exceeding the long-term average. This may partly be due to the establishment of the Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve and the various soil and vegetation recovery programs undertaken since 2000. With the sharp decrease of run-off and sediment to the lower and estuarine reaches of the Yellow River, more effective measures for water and hydro-ecological systems conservation need to be implemented in the source zone.},

  abstract = {Drylands are one of the most diverse yet highly vulnerable social-ecological systems on Earth. Water scarcity has contributed to high levels of heterogeneity, variability and unpredictability, which together have shaped the long coadaptative process of coupling humans and nature. Land degradation and desertification in drylands are some of the largest and most far-reaching global environmental and social change problems, and thus are a daunting challenge for science and society. In this study, we merged the Drylands Development Paradigm, Holling's adaptive cycle metaphor and resilience theory to assess the challenges and opportunities for livelihood development in the Amapola dryland social-ecological system (DSES), a small isolated village in the semi-arid region of Mexico. After 450 years of local social-ecological evolution, external drivers (neoliberal policies, change in land reform legislation) have become the most dominant force in livelihood development, at the cost of loss of natural and cultural capital and an increasingly dysfunctional landscape. Local DSESs have become increasingly coupled to dynamic larger-scale drivers. Hence, cross-scale connectedness feeds back on and transforms local self-sustaining subsistence farming conditions, causing loss of livelihood resilience and diversification in a globally changing world. Effective efforts to combat desertification and improve livelihood security in DSESs need to consider their cyclical rhythms. Hence, we advocate novel dryland stewardship strategies, which foster adaptive capacity, and continuous evaluation and social learning at all levels. Finally, we call for an effective, flexible and viable policy framework that enhances local biotic and cultural diversity of drylands to transform global drylands into a resilient biome in the context of global environmental and social change.},

Here, we focus on the potential for social and ecological impacts from freshwater stress and storage loss. We find basins with existing freshwater stress are drying (losing storage) disproportionately, exacerbating the challenges facing the water stressed versus non-stressed basins of the world. We map the global gradient in social-ecological vulnerability to freshwater stress and storage loss and identify hotspot basins for prioritization (               n               \,=\,168). These most-vulnerable basins encompass over 1.5 billion people, 17\% of global food crop production, 13\% of global gross domestic product, and hundreds of significant wetlands. There are thus substantial social and ecological benefits to reducing vulnerability in hotspot basins, which can be achieved through hydro-diplomacy, social adaptive capacity building, and integrated water resources management practices.},

We find the disparity between the water `haves' and `have nots' of the world continues to widen2. Nearly one in two people who live in areas of extreme water shortage experienced drying over the 14-year observation period while a fifth of crop calories produced for human food are grown in regions that dried yet already suffer from water shortage. The global water availability trends reveal a clear human imprint1 and reflect a world-wide inability to manage water resources for long term water security. We identify 21 regions that stand to face especially high social-ecological system pressures from the water availability trends and assess flooding and water scarcity vulnerability at the global scale. This application of remotely sensed water availability trends contributes to the quantitative diagnosis of the world's contemporary water security challenges that will be useful in global policy directive setting.},

The integrated framework of telecoupling examines flows of information, energy, matter, people, organisms, and other things such as financial capital and goods and products around the globe. It pinpoints causes and effects arising from engagement of diverse agents in the global sphere. This first special feature on telecoupling includes 16 articles that explore diverse telecouplings including trade, migration, tourism, information exchange, and transnational product certification schemes. Here we synthesize the articles by describing eight overarching lessons learned. These include the impact of physical, social, and institutional distance on telecouplings, key roles of agents and their inter-relationships, and the important function of telecoupling in enhancing information signals over long distances. Several lessons directly apply to global sustainability challenges, such as the importance of recognizing trade-offs between local and global sustainability and the need for multi-level management and governance solutions. We also suggest five areas of future research to help propel this nascent field forward and further cement its applicability to addressing global sustainability challenges.},

  abstract = {Purpose Significant changes in the runoff and sediment load have been detected in many catchments of the Loess Plateau. These changes are expected to be influenced by the interplay of climate variability and human activities. Quantitatively evaluating these effects is crucial for framing climate variability adaptation measures and the assessment and management of regional water resources. Materials and methods Based on the annual rainfall, runoff, and sediment load data taken over the period from 1974 to 2013 and using data from 112 flood events, this study investigates the runoff and sediment load variations at the annual scale and distinguishes the impacts of climate variability and human activities at the event scale. The Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test are employed to detect the trends and abrupt change points of the annual runoff and sediment load. Rainfall and land surface conditions play a dominant role in the runoff and sediment yield of flood events. However, vegetation recovery, which benefits from the Grain-for-Green project and the construction of check dams has greatly changed the land surface condition, resulting in a reduction in streamflow energy, hydrological connectivity, and flood peaks. Therefore, for two flood events with similar rainfall conditions but different runoff and sediment yield, the differences in the runoff and sediment load within paired events may be attributed to the changes in the land surface condition induced by human activities. Results and discussion The results showed that the annual runoff and sediment load has significantly decreasing trends (p {$<$} 0.05). The abrupt changing point was detected in 1996, dividing the runoff and sediment load series into a baseline period (1974-1995) and a changing period (1996-2013). At the flood event scale, the hysteresis analysis showed that the counter-clockwise and figure-eight loops are the 01_manuscript patterns for both of the periods. The relationships between the runoff depth (H) and sediment yield (SY) varied greatly in 2007-2013 compared with those during 1974-1989. Human activities accounted for an average of 47 and 81\% for the changes in the runoff and sediment load, respectively, and the remainder was attributable to climate variability. Conclusions Human activities have a greater effect on the sediment load reduction in the Xichuan River catchment, while climate variability accounted for more of the runoff changes.},

  abstract = {The surface water resources of a typical semi-arid watershed (Huangfuchuan) in the middle reaches of the Yellow River have drastically decreased over the past decade, which has affected the governance strategies of the entire Yellow River. The causes of the decrease in surface water are generally attributed to climate fluctuations and human activities. In this study, a distributed biosphere hydrological model the Water and Energy Budget-based Distributed Hydrological Model (WEB-DHM) and a Contribution Assessment method were jointly applied to diagnose and quantify climate and human impacts on the streamflow change. Long-term hydrometeorological trends were analysed first and one major change-point (in 1998) in the annual streamflow series was identified through the nonparametric Mann-Kendall test and the annual precipitation-streamflow double cumulative curve method. The WEB-DHM model was calibrated and validated over the baseline period of 1985-1998; the natural streamflow was reconstructed for the impacted period of 1999-2006. Then, the contributions of climate fluctuations and human activities to streamflow change were determined quantitatively by comparing the natural streamflow with the observed value. The mean annual streamflow significantly decreased from 34.05 mm year(-1) to 13.72 mm year(-1) in the baseline and impacted periods, respectively, showing a reduction of 60\%. Climate fluctuations accounted for a decrease in mean annual streamflow of approximately 10.38 mm year(-1) (51.03\%), whereas human activities (including soil-water conservation measures, artificial water intakes and man-made water storage infrastructure) caused a decrease of approximately 9.96 mm year(-1) (48.97\%). These findings are potentially helpful to support the water resources planning and management in the middle reaches of the Yellow River.},

The Gushanchuan river, a primary tributary of the middle Yellow river, Northern China, showed a significant downward trend in the last century. Little is known regarding the relative contributions of changing environment to the observed hydrological trends and response on the runoff generation process in its watershed. On the basis of observed hydrological and meteorological data from 1965-2010, the Mann-Kendall trend test and climate elasticity method were used to distinguish the effects of climate change and human activities on runoff in the Gushanchuan basin. The results indicate that the runoff in the Gushanchuan Basin has experienced significant declines as large as 77\% from 1965 to 2010, and a mutation point occurred around 1997; the contribution rate of climate change to runoff change is 12.9-15.1\%, and the contribution rate of human activities to runoff change is 84.9-87.1\%. Then we divided long-term data sequence into two stages around the mutation point, and analyzed runoff generation mechanisms based on land use and cover changes (LUCC). We found that the floods in the Gushanchuan Basin were still dominated by Excess-infiltration runoff, but the proportion in 1965-1997 and 1998-2010 decreased gradually (68.46\% and 45.83\% in turn). The proportion of Excess-storage runoff and Mixed runoff has increased, which means that the runoff is made up of more runoff components. The variation law of the LUCC indicates that the forest area increased by 49.61\%, the confluence time increased by 50.42\%, and the water storage capacity of the watershed increased by 30.35\%.},

  abstract = {In many parts of the world groundwater is being depleting at an alarming rate. Where groundwater extraction is licenced, regulators often respond to resource depletion by reducing all individual licences by a fixed proportion. This approach can be effective in achieving a reduction in the volume of water extracted, but the approach is not efficient. In water resource management the issue of the equity-efficiency trade-off has been explored in a number of contexts, but not in the context of allocation from a groundwater system. To contribute to this knowledge gap we conduct an empirical case study for Western Australia's most important groundwater system: the Gnangara Groundwater System (GGS). Resource depletion is a serious issue for the GGS, and substantial reductions in groundwater extraction are required to stabilise the system. Using an individual-based farm optimization model we study both the overall impact and the distributional impact of a fixed percentage water allocation cut to horticulture sector licence holders. The model is parameterised using water licence specific data on farm area and water allocation. The modelling shows that much of the impact of water allocation reductions can be mitigated through changing the cropping mix and the irrigation technology used. The modelling also shows that the scope for gains through the aggregation of holdings into larger farms is much greater than the potential losses due to water allocation reductions. The impact of water allocation cuts is also shown to impact large farms more than small farms. For example, the expected loss in net revenue per ha for a 10-ha farm is around three times the expected loss per ha for a 1-ha farm; and the expected loss per ha for a 25-ha farm is around five times the expected loss per ha for a 1-ha farm.},

Accordingly, to explore the features of climate changes in sub-basins of the Source Region of Yellow River (SRYR), absolute changes and trends of temperature variables, maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tavg) and diurnal temperature range (DTR), were analyzed annually and seasonally by using daily observed air temperature dataset from 1965 to 2014. Results showed that annual Tmax, Tmin and Tavg for the SRYR were experiencing warming trends respectively at the rate of 0.28, 0.36 and 0.31A degrees C (10 yr)(-1). In comparison with the 1st period (1965-1989), more absolute changes and trends towards increasing were observed during the 2nd period (1990-2014). Apart from Tangnaihai (a low altitude sub-basin), these increasing trends and changes seemed more significant in other basins with highest magnitude during winter. Among sub-basins the increasing trends were more dominant in Huangheyan compared to other sub-basins. The largest increase magnitude of Tmin, 1.24 and 1.18A degrees C (10 yr)(-1), occurred in high altitude sub-basins Jimai and Huangheyan, respectively, while the smallest increase magnitude of 0.23A degrees C (10 yr)(-1) occurred in a low altitude sub-basin Tangnaihai. The high elevation difference in Tangnaihai probably was the 01_manuscript reason for the less increase in the magnitude of Tmin. In the last decade, smaller magnitude of trend for all temperature variables signified the signal of cooling in the region. Overall, changes of temperature variables had significant spatial and seasonal variations. It implies that seasonal variations of runoff might be greater or different for each sub-basin.},

We employ a detailed model of the Willamette River Basin, Oregon, to evaluate the effectiveness of a variety of potential drought policy interventions to conserve or reallocate water during a simulated near-term drought year. The drought year is characterized by early-season low flows that make it impossible to meet water demands.

Such daunting task is mainly attributed to the concerns that greenhouse gas emission climate change may tip the water cycle into an unfavorable new state. Up to date, tipping points occurring in complex dynamical systems have been identified across a large set of disciplines. In most proven tipping points, hydrologic variables are always taken as the control variables, as changes in water fluxes and stocks are known to act as stressors of socioecological systems, and the affected aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems as the response variables. The 01_manuscript objective of this study is to explore the existence of tipping points in catchment-scale freshwater availability, that is, the tipping points were the response variable is catchment water storage. We first review the existence of reported tipping points in the field of hydrology and water resources, to establish a coherent framework for the identification of hydrological tipping points. We explore their mathematical existence at the catchment scale by Linear Stability Analysis, illustrating cases with potential functions and bifurcation diagrams. We then explore any possible contribution to the existence of hydrological tipping points by adding complexity to the hydrological dynamic system through the inclusion of sociological feedbacks. We find that even with the inclusion of the moisture feedback of evapotranspiration to precipitation, constant socioecological conditions will most likely not present tipping points of water storage in the catchment. However, the inclusion of socioecological feedbacks does generate tipping points under certain assumptions, even without assuming a moisture feedback between evapotranspiration and precipitation. We hope that this study sheds some light on the existence, conditions, assumptions and characteristics of large-scale hydrological tipping points with long-term implications.\&lt;/p\&gt;},

We investigated these global effects from 1901 to 2008, using hydroclimatic observations in 100 large hydrological basins. Globally, we find consistent and dominant effects of increasing relative evapotranspiration from both activities, and decreasing temporal runoff variability from flow regulation. The evapotranspiration effect increases the long-term average human consumption of fresh water by 3563 +/- 979 km(3)/year from 1901-1954 to 1955-2008. This increase raises a recent estimate of the current global water footprint of humanity by around 18\%, to 10,688 +/- 979 km(3)/year. The results highlight the global impact of local water-use activities and call for their relevant account in Earth system modeling.},

  abstract = {Compared to rain, dew is an important supplementary source of water for the survival of certain plants and animals in drylands. However, the hydrology of dew has not yet been fully investigated due to difficulties in measuring the amount and duration of it. In this study, a 3-year in-situ monitoring experiment was conducted from 2014 to 2016 in the semi-arid Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province of China, using a leaf wetness sensor (LWS) and four associated meteorological instruments. Results showed that the average annual total dewfall was 32.8 mm with a daily maximum of 0.88 mm. The majority of daily dew occurred in the night from 18:00 to 8:00 with the maximum condensation rate occurring at around 4:00. The maximum dew residence time was about 18 h/day on the dew days in all seasons. However, the actual dew production period was about 14 h in spring (March-May), autumn (September-November), and winter (December-February), and only 11 h in summer (June-August). The maximum intensity and amount of dew always occurred in autumn (with an average amount of 12.2 mm or 37\% of the annual total), followed closely by spring (11.4 mm, 35\%), with much less in summer (6.6 mm, 20\%) and winter (2.6 mm, 8\%). The annual dew distribution by months showed a double crest variation, with two peaks in April-May and October-November, and two valleys in January-February and July. Comparatively, annual dewfall is only about 1/18th of the rainfall in this region, but the number of dew days (224 days, or 61\% of year) is 2.6 times that of rain days (87 days, 24\%), making dew a critical supplementary source of water for mitigating dry periods and supporting native plants and animals. Rain and dew are highly complementary as dew occurs in cloudless nights while the rain occurs in different and on much fewer occasions in the region. The dew amount was highly and positively correlated to the relative humidity of the air above the threshold of 81\% (r = 0.78, p {$<$} 0.01), negatively correlated to the difference between air temperature T-a and dewpoint T-d, when (T-a - T-d) is less than 4 degrees C (r = -0.66, p {$<$} 0.01), and weakly correlated to wind speed (0.2 to 2 ms(-1)), wind direction, surface soil moisture, and temperature. In the Sanyuan region, two general wind directions, 30 degrees-90 degrees and 210 degrees-270 degrees, were more favorable for the formation of dew.},

We hypothesized that temporal trends in multifaceted components of diversity would be highly congruent, but that the relative importance of anthropogenic disturbances would differ in shaping spatial patterns of fish diversity. We found that all three components of alpha diversity increased over time but at different rates (19.1\%, 21.3\% and 15.3\% for taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversity, respectively). Fish faunas of the Yellow River have also become homogenized over time, but this was much greater for functional and phylogenetic components of beta diversity than for taxonomic diversity (change in beta diversity = - 0.11, - 0.24 and - 0.02, respectively). Temporal changes in alpha and beta diversity were strongly related to invasion of non-native fish species and changes in temperature, sediment load, reservoir capacity and aquaculture area. Our results underscore the ongoing need for threat mitigation (particularly relating to dams and aquaculture) to conserve the unique biodiversity of one of the world's largest rivers.},

  abstract = {Water is a major limiting factor of human survival and social economic development. Water security is also important for the ecological system. In this paper, the water security assessment index system of the Yellow River basin was developed based on three subsystems: the water resources subsystem, the water environment subsystem and the social economic subsystem. The integrated assessment of water security was developed based on the combination of set pair analysis (SPA) and fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) as well as technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS), gray relational analysis (GRA), vague sets (VS) and matter element (ME) models. First, fuzzy cluster analysis method was used to check the consistency of all the models before and after implementing the integrated assessment. Secondly, the ranking values of four single assessment models (i.e., TOPSIS, GRA, VS and ME models) were analyzed by SPA method to get the consistency connection degree. Then FAHP was constructed to describe the relative importance of the four different single models when determining the weight coefficient in the integrated assessment model. And lastly, the integrated assessment model of water security was developed based on the ranking values and weight coefficients of the selected single assessment models. The conclusion of the developed integrated assessment model which was applied in the Yellow River basin showed that Sichuan province was at security level; Henan, Shandong, Qinghai and Shaanxi provinces were at the threshold security level; Shanxi, Gansu and Inner Mongolia provinces were at the relative insecurity level; Ningxia province was water no secure. The integrated assessment results showed that the improved integrated model presented in this paper had relatively better performance than single assessment models. The intention of this paper was to provide an integrated assessment model, propose potential countermeasures, and achieve sustainable water utilization in the Yellow River basin.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Yangtze Economic Belt is one of the most dynamic regions in China in terms of population growth, economic progress, industrialization, and urbanization. It faces many resource constraints (food, energy) and environmental challenges (pollution, biodiversity loss) under rapid population growth and economic development. Interactions between human and natural systems are at the heart of the challenges facing the sustainable development of the Yangtze Economic Belt. Understanding these interactions poses challenges because human and natural systems evolve in response to a wide range of influences. Accounting for these complex dynamics requires a system tool that can represent the fundamental drivers of change and responses of the individual system as well as how different systems interact and co-evolve. By adopting the system thinking and the methodology of system dynamics simulation, an integrated assessment model for the Yangtze Economic Belt, named ANEMI\_Yangtze, is developed based on the third version of the global integrated assessment model, ANEMI. Nine sectors of population, economy, land, food, energy, water, carbon, nutrients, and fish are currently included in ANEMI\_Yangtze. This paper identifies the opportunities and challenges facing the Yangtze Economic Belt and presents the ANEMI\_Yangtze model structure. It also includes: (i) the identification of the cross-sectoral interactions and feedbacks involved in shaping Yangtze Economic Belt's system behaviour over time; (ii) the identification of the feedbacks within each sector that drive the state variables in that sector; and (iii) the explanation of the theoretical and mathematical basis for those feedbacks. ANEMI\_Yangtze was developed and calibrated sector by sector before coupling them together into complete ANEMI\_Yangtze model. After the validation and robustness test, the ANEMI\_Yangtze model can be used to support decision making, policy assessment, and scenario development. This study aims to improve the understanding of the complex interactions among human and natural systems in the Yangtze Economic Belt to provide foundation for science-based policies for the sustainable development of the economic belt.},

  abstract = {Restoring disturbed and over-exploited ecosystems is an important part of mitigating human pressures on natural ecosystems. An ambitious ecological restoration program, the Grain for Green Program (GFGP), was launched in 1999 in China. We selected the Loess Plateau (LP) as a case study, and evaluated ecosystem changes between 2000 and 2012 using biophysical models, observation records, and literature data. It was observed that both the warming and wetting of climate and the ecological program promoted vegetation growth and biomass production (i.e., carbon sequestration). Overall ecosystem patterns were relatively stable; grassland, residential land, and forest increased in area, while farmland area decreased slightly. Increasing precipitation throughout the study period was related to fluctuations in soil retention and hydrological regulation. Vegetation restoration induced by climate variability and the ecological program played a significant role in soil retention enhancement, which also substantially reduced sediment load. The land-use conversion in ecological restoration program promoted soil carbon sequestration, but featured differences in conversion types and rainfall zones. The ecosystem changes recorded in the LP, which resulted from both the ecological program and climate variability, might be temporary improvements rather than fundamental ecosystem shifts. The success of this ecological restoration in the LP exemplifies the positive effects of environmental policies and the necessity of adopting an adaptive management approach. However, the current assessment was not comprehensive, as it involved only three dominant regulating services, and there were still trade-offs among multiple ecosystem services. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the interactions and trade-offs among ecosystem services is required to explore in the context of emerging climate change, so as to support environmental management that maximizes ecosystem benefits to human well-being.},

Earlier concepts about the ages of the river's formation are quite controversial. This paper investigates the age of the Samen Gorge, the last gorge along the course of Yellow River before it reaches the sea. The 01_manuscript research materials presented here are: (a) 172.1-m-thick loess-palaeosol sequence in Mangshan located in the south side of the Yellow River, (b) Lacustrine sediments of the former Sanmen Lake. The chronology is based on the stratigraphical correlations with the well-dated loess-palaeosol sequence in Luochuan of central Loess Plateau, palaeomagnetism and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and thermoluminescence (TL) datings. An abrupt increase in the rate of sedimentation is recognized in the stratigraphical layers L-2 and above of the Mangshan sequence. The loess unit L-1 and palaeosol unit S-1 of Mangshan are much thicker than those of other sections in Loess Plateau as well, indicating a new and unique source only for the Mangshan region. The aeolian deposition of the loess is found to have started at ca. 150 ka in the bottom of the former large lake west of the Sanmen Gorge and suggests desiccation of the former Sanmen lake. At this point in time, the Yellow River could bring large amount of fluvial sediment east of the Sanmen Gorge after the gorge was downcut. The fluvial sediment is suggested to be the new source of loess identified in the Mangshan sequence. Therefore, it is concluded that the downcutting of the Sanmen Gorge started at ca. 150 ka and indicates the full development of the Yellow River. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Meanwhile, one specific ecological restoration project named as the "Wuwanmu" and followed by the "Shiwanmu" within the National Nature Reserve of the Yellow River Delta (NNRYRD) complicated the hydrological and biological connectivity. How to quantitatively evaluate the extent of coastal wetland affected by the project will be a difficult problem. Hence the authors presented three innovative models of the Marine Connectivity Change Index (MCCI), the Coupling Index of Hydro-biological Connectivity (CIHBC), and the Assessment Index of Suitability on Bird Habitats (AISBH). After the project, the habitat of Phragmites australis has been restored effectively with the increased area of 24.59\%, while the habitat of Suaeda salsa as the native species lost largely with decreased area of 84.62\%. And the tidal channel having been cut off by the project resulted in isolating the buildup restoration area from seawater, and reshaping completely the plant habitat environment. So the hydrological and biological connectivity has been changed largely with the 47.79\% decreased MCCI area and the 16.3\% decreased zero-valued CIHBC area. However the AISBH non-zero-valued area increased 10.7\%, and with the hidden worry of the decreased Grallatores number. From the connectivity prospective, three models presented a significant methodology to evaluate the complex impact on the estuary wetland habitat caused by the restoration project. In the long run, the ecological impacts should be highlighted to the change of tidal channel and the corresponding tidal issues, and the continuous and big loss of native plant spices such as S. salsa. The further study needs to explore the longer-term assessment of the ecological restoration project and its multiple effect in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study investigated the streamflow and sediment discharge changes in the headwaters of Yellow River Basin (YRB) and Yangtze River Basin (YARB) by using long-term hydro meteorological data from 1956 to 2012. The nonparametric Mann - Kendall test, Pettitt test, cumulative anomaly curve (CAC), and double cumulative curve (DCC) were used to identify trends and change points of the hydro-meteorological variables and quantify the response of streamflow and sediment discharge to climate change and anthropogenic activities. The results are as follows. (1) Slightly decreasing trend in streamflow and increasing trend in sediment discharge were detected from 1956 to 2012 in the headwater of YRB. Meanwhile, both streamflow and sediment discharge in the headwater of YARB showed increasing trend. Change-point analyses further revealed that turning (transition) years existed and the abrupt decline in streamflow and sediment discharge began in 1989. (2)The specific sediment yield-runoff depth and sediment concentration-streamflow relationships in the two basins could be well fitted by the power function on the annual, flood season, and monthly, scales. Sediment productive ability of runoff during the flood season was much greater than that over the full year. (3) The headwater of YRB contributed huge amount of water resources and very little sediment to the downstream, however, the headwater of YARB had little influence on downstream. (4) Compared with the baseline period (1956-1989), precipitation reduction played a major role in the streamflow and sediment discharge reductions in the post-baseline period (1990-2012). Given the scarcity of soil and water resources, anthropogenic and climatic impacts on streamflow and sediment discharge must be given more attention in the future. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The fragile environment poses a threat to ecological safety and sustainable development on the LP and neighboring areas. The ecosystem on the LP has undergone great changes in recent decades owing to dramatic climate change, ecological rehabilitation, and tremendous human pressure. This study was focused on quantifying and assessing the multiple ecosystem services from 2000 to 2012, based on actual observation records and widely used biophysical models. These included Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), and rainfall storage method. Furthermore, in this study, the roles of climate variability and an ecological restoration program on vegetation activity and ecosystem services were investigated, as well as the synergies between multiple ecosystem services. The slight increase in both precipitation and temperature during 2000-2012, in conjunction with ecological rehabilitation, induced a trend of increasing in vegetation cover and productivity. During 2000-2012, the overall soil retention function was slightly enhanced while the amount of hydrological regulation decreased. The biomass production (vegetation carbon sequestration) and food production increased sharply. The increasing precipitation intensified water erosion by enhancing rainfall erosivity, whereas the reduction in wind speed lessened wind erosion and thereby reduced the frequency and duration of sandstorm events. Vegetation restoration supported by climate variability and resulting from ecological projects also played positive roles in soil retention enhancement. The spatial correlation analyses indicated synergies between multiple regulating ecosystem services. There was also a synergy between food production and carbon sequestration in vegetation. The performance of ecological rehabilitation and changes in ecosystem services on the LP exemplified the need for ecological conservation to take climate variability into account, and to facilitate synergies involving multiple ecosystem services, to maximize human well-being and preserve natural ecosystems.

The analysis of field data shows that over the period of 1977-2005, the changes in climate (decrease in precipitation and increase in air temperature) and human interventions (increase in water diversion projects) throughout the watershed have resulted in the sharp reductions of river flow and sediment discharges into the Bohai Sea. Consequently, over the decadal timescale, morphological evolution of the YRSD has gone through three stages: i.e. rapid accumulation (5.77 x 10(8) m(3)/year) in 1977-1985, moderate accumulation (3.80 x 10(8) m(3)/year) in 1986-1995 and slow accumulation (0.91 x 10(8) m3/year) in 1996-2005. Climatic change within the catchmentycharacterized by the rapid increase of air temperature contributed significantly to the transitions from the rapid accumulation to the moderate accumulation, and to the subsequent slow accumulation. The decadal morphological changes of the YRSD also show peculiar deposition/erosion characteristics over the medium timescale under river input reduction. Within the three decades, the patterns of the 01_manuscript sedimentary body exhibit irregular ellipses with the long axis parallel to the -5 or -10 m isobaths and short axis perpendicular to the isobaths. The depocentres of the YRSD are located between the -10 and -15 m isobaths close to the respective river mouths, with a high vertical accretion rate of similar to 1.20 m/year. The time series data of annual volumetric change of the YRSD and river sediment load from 1977 to 2005 further demonstrate significant linear positive relationships between deltaic geomorphic change and fluvial input over shorter timescales (annual and 3-year). The critical sediment discharges for maintaining the deposition/erosion equilibrium state of the YRSD over the annual and 3-year timescales are found to be 1.79 x 10(8) t/year and 1.29 x 10(8) t/year, respectively. The analysis from the latest hydrological data (2006-2015) suggests that over the decadal timescale, the evolution state of the YRSD currently has transitioned from constructive to destructive due to the weakened fluvial input. Moreover, there exists a close quantitative link between the progradation of the Yellow River subaerial delta (YRAD) and the YRSD over the five-year timescale, indicating that every 1 x 10(8) m(3)/year increase of the YRAD's yearly volumetric change will result in a 3.28 km(2)/year increase of the YRAD's yearly land-accretion area, and the YRAD will reach the extension/retreat balance state when yearly morphological change of the YRSD is at 0.73 x 10(8) m(3)/year.},

  abstract = {Human deinands for natural resources have significantly changed the natural landscape and induced ecological degradation and associated ecosystem services. An understanding of the patterns, interactions, and drivers of ecosystem services is essential for the ecosystem management and guiding targeted land use policy-making. The Losses Plateau (LP) provides ecosystem services including the carbon sequestration and soil retention, and exerts tremendous impacts on the midstream and downstream of the Yellow River. Three dominant ecosystem services between 2000 and 2012 within the LP were presented based on multiple source datasets and biophysical models. In addition, paired ecosystem services interactions were quantified using the correlation analysis and constraint line approach. The 01_manuscript conclusions are as follows. It was observed that the warming and wetting climate and ecological program jointly promoted the vegetation growth and carbon sequestration. The increasing precipitation throughout 2000-2012 was related to the soil retention and hydrological regulation fluctuations. The vegetation restoration played a positive role in the soil retention enhancement, thus substantially reduced water and sediment yields. The relationships between ecosystem services were not only correlations (tradeoffs or synergies), but rather constraint effects. The constraint effects between the three paired ecosystem services could be classified as the negative convex (carbon sequestration vs. hydrological regulation) and hump-shaped (soil retention vs. carbon sequestration and soil retention vs. hydrological regulation), and the coefficients of determination for the entire LP were 0.78, 0.84, and 0.65, respectively. In the LP, the rainfall (water availability) was the key constraint factor that affected the relationships between the paired ecosystem services. The spatially explicit mapping of ecosystem services and interaction analyses utilizing constraint line approach enriched the understanding of connections between ecosystem services and the potential drivers, which had important implications for the land use planning and landscapes services optimizing.},

  abstract = {In the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) was widely planted for soil conservation and afforestation purposes during the past three decades. Investigating biophysical controls on canopy transpiration (E-c) of the plantations is essential to understanding the effects of afforestation on watershed hydrology and regional water resources. In addition to monitoring of micrometeorology and soil water content, sap flux densities (F-d) of six representative trees in a 27-year stand were continuously measured using thermal dissipation probes during the growing seasons in 2013 and 2014. Ec was derived by multiplying stand total sapwood area (A(ST)) with F-d. The daily mean E-c in the growing season was 0.14 and 0.23 mm day(-1) in 2013 and 2014, respectively. The responses of daily E-c to R-s and vapour pressure deficit were explained with an exponential threshold model. The variability of monthly E-c was mainly explained by leaf area index (LAI) (R-2 = 0.92). The inter-annual variability of E-c was influenced by LAI that fluctuated dramatically during 2013 and 2014. We found that the status of soil water content at the beginning of the growing season had large impacts on LAI and E-c during the growing season. Contrary to common beliefs that the plantation uses a large amount of water, we found that the black locust plantation had rather low transpiration rates (5.3\% of precipitation and 4.6\% of ET0). This study suggests that the black locust plantation has adapted to local soil water condition by reducing transpiration, and the major water loss from the plantation was not transpiration.

  abstract = {Transpiration (Tr) is influenced by environmental factors, vegetation properties, and anthropogenic management. The effect of environmental factors on Tr are taking place from two aspects: evaporative demand (i.e., potential evapotranspiration, PET) and water supply (i.e., soil water). Soil water is one of the most important factors that limit plant transpiration in terrestrial ecosystems, especially in semi-arid and arid regions. Investigating the relationship between Tr and soil water is crucial for an improved understanding of plant survival strategies and predicting hydrological cycles and water resources under climate change. Although the relationships of soil water and Tr have been widely studied, the independent effects of soil water on Tr are difficult to separate because soil water and PET occur concurrently under natural conditions. This study carried out field observations of sapflow density, meteorological factors and soil water in a black locust (Roblin:a pseudoacacia) plantation in the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China. This information was used to develop a model integrating the daily PET and relative extractable soil water (REW, an index that represents the available soil water): Tr = (0.27 x PET - 0.02 x PET2 - 0.32) x (1 - e(-5.70 x) (REW)). The model fitted the measured data well (R-2 = 0.65 and RMSE = 0.06 mm day(-1)). We found that the daily Tr increased as the REW increased under varying PET levels. Additionally, the independent effects of soil water on Tr were analysed using the factorial experiment analysis method. The REW was manipulated and PET varied naturally during the measurements to separate the independent effects of the REW on Tr. The results showed that Tr increased with the REW during the study period at a rate of 0.53 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW when the REW {$<$} 0.4 and 0.09 mm day(-1) per 0.1 REW beyond the threshold (REW = 0.4). Tr increased by 27.3 mm (43.7\%) compared to the controlled Tr (observed PET and lowest REW) due to the effects of increasing REW (ranging from 0.14 similar to 0.81) during the study period (growing seasons of 2015 and 2016). Furthermore, canopy-level stomatal conductance was calculated using a simplified inverted Penman-Monteith equation. The reference canopy-level stomatal conductance (Gsref), which represents the Gs capacity and its sensitivity to soil water, showed an increasing response with increasing REW, which is the possible reason for the Tr dynamics with the REW. Our study provided an improved understanding of the soil water-Tr relationship and predicted effects of climate change on tree water use. Although the method required abundant field observation data, we have provided a feasible method of accurately quantifying the independent contribution of soil water on forest Tr.},

  abstract = {Re-vegetation is a necessary control measure of soil erosion in the Loess Plateau. However, excessive re-vegetation can aggravate soil water shortage, which can in turn threaten the health and services of restored ecosystems. An optimal plant cover or biomass (i.e., soil-water carrying capacity for vegetation, SWCCV) is important for regional water balance, soil protection and vegetation sustainability. The objective of this study was to determine the spatial distribution of SWCCV for three non-native tree (Robinia pseudoacaia), shrub (Caragana korshinskii) and grass (Medicago sativa) species used in the re-vegetation of the Loess Plateau. The dynamics of actual evapotranspiration (AET), net primary productivity (NPP) and leaf area index (LAI) were simulated using a modified Biome-BGC (Bio-Geochemical Cycles) model. Soil and physiological parameters required by the model were validated using field-observed AET for the three plant species at six sites in the study area. The validated model was used to simulate the dynamics of AET, NPP and LAI for the three plant species at 243 representative sites in the study area for the period 1961-2014. The results show that spatial distributions of mean AET, NPP and LAI generally increased from northwest to southeast, much the same as mean annual precipitation (MAP) gradient. In terms of maximum LAI, the ranges of optimal plant cover were 1.1-3.5 for R. pseudoacaia, 1.0-2.4 for C. korshinskii and 0.7-3.0 for M. sativa. The corresponding SWCCV, expressed as NPP were 202.4-616.5, 83.7-201.7 and 56.3-253.0 g(-2) yr(-1). MAP, mean annual temperature, soil texture and elevation were the 01_manuscript variables driving SWCCV under the plant species; explaining over 86\% of the spatial variations in mean NPP in the study area. Further re-vegetation therefore needs careful reconsideration under the prevailing climatic, soil and topographic conditions. The results of the study provide a re-vegetation threshold to guide future re-vegetation activities and to ensure a sustainable eco-hydrological environment in the Loess Plateau.},

  abstract = {During the Anthropocene, regulating river discharge by high dams may have mat the need for water demands in river basins, but resulted in carrying less freshwater and sediment to the sea, inducing land degradation and shoreline retreat in worldwide mega-river deltas. In land-ocean interaction, tide response to water discharge changes plays an important role and is crucial for the river-laden sediment transfer and dispersal, affecting both nearshore and estuarine deposits. The Yellow River Delta (YRD), which is under an increasing pressure of the new discharge regime of the Yellow River, has undergone drastic changes in terms of sediment dynamics and morphologic evolution. To gain a better understanding of the overall fluvial and marine hydrodynamics and morphodynamic processes in the YRD, in this study, a full-scale numerical model is built to investigate the interaction and impacts of changing environmental forcing and dynamics on flow and sediment transport in the estuary of YRD and its adjacent coasts. The results show that the river discharge strongly affects the tidal dynamics and morphology of the delta, particularly in the close vicinity of the outlet and the intertidal zone. Tidal constituents M2 and K1, which are the most significant ones in the YRD, are found to be noticeably affected with a decreasing trend when the river discharge increases. The model results also indicate that river discharge affects the location and intensity of the shear front that occurs in the nearshore areas of the YRD. Increasing the river discharge can induce a seaward movement of the shear front, reduce its width and concentrate its shear intensity. It is found that the reverse of the flow direction at each side of the shear front and strong longshore tidal current can act as a barrier for the sediment dispersal process by keeping suspended sediment in the inner zone, thus to form a particular sediment deposition zone and the depo-center.},

  abstract = {Storm runoff is important for maintaining surface water resources, while this function is significantly affected by land use and land cover changes, e.g., afforestation and reforestation. The Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) has undergone large-scale vegetation rehabilitation, especially afforestation over the past 20 years. We hypothesize that afforestation has profoundly changed the amounts and mechanisms of storm runoff generation in headwater catchments on the CLP. To test this hypothesis, rainfall, soil moisture, and streamflow were monitored in a grass catchment and an adjacent forest catchment for two consecutive years. The objective of this study was to elucidate the varied mechanisms of storm runoff generation in these two contrasting revegetated catchments. Results showed that (1) average runoff coefficient in the grassland catchment (0.042) was approximately ten times higher than that in the forestland catchment (0.004), confirming the impact of catchment afforestation on the suppression of storm runoff generation. (2) Peak rainfall intensity was the first-order control of the runoff coefficient in the grassland catchment, but not in the forestland catchment. (3) Threshold values for antecedent soil moisture (similar to 18\%) and the sum of antecedent soil moisture index and event precipitation (similar to 210 mm) were identified in the grassland catchment, above which storm runoff significantly increased. (4) Two extraordinary high runoff coefficient events were observed in the grassland catchment, one due to high peak rainfall intensity and strong surface runoff and the other due to high rainfall amount and high antecedent soil moisture. We conclude that long-term afforestation has changed the mechanisms and patterns of storm runoff generation, and different conditions of rainfall intensity, rainfall amount and antecedent soil moisture determined the hydrological connectivity between the upper hillslope and downhill gully in the catchment. This study deepens our understanding of the mechanisms and thresholds of storm runoff generation in headwater catchments on the CLP. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Tropical forest loss currently exceeds forest gain, leading to a net greenhouse gas emission that exacerbates global climate change. This has sparked scientific debate on how to achieve natural climate solutions. Central to this debate is whether sustainably managing forests and protected areas will deliver global climate mitigation benefits, while ensuring local peoples' health and well-being. Here, we evaluate the 10-y impact of a human-centered solution to achieve natural climate mitigation through reductions in illegal logging in rural Borneo: an intervention aimed at expanding health care access and use for communities living near a national park, with clinic discounts offsetting costs historically met through illegal logging. Conservation, education, and alternative livelihood programs were also offered. We hypothesized that this would lead to improved health and well-being, while also alleviating illegal logging activity within the protected forest. We estimated that 27.4 km               2               of deforestation was averted in the national park over a decade ({$\sim$}70\% reduction in deforestation compared to a synthetic control, permuted               P               = 0.038). Concurrently, the intervention provided health care access to more than 28,400 unique patients, with clinic usage and patient visitation frequency highest in communities participating in the intervention. Finally, we observed a dose\textendash response in forest change rate to intervention engagement (person-contacts with intervention activities) across communities bordering the park: The greatest logging reductions were adjacent to the most highly engaged villages. Results suggest that this community-derived solution simultaneously improved health care access for local and indigenous communities and sustainably conserved carbon stocks in a protected tropical forest.},

The average sediment trapped by Sanmenxia Reservoir was 1.45x10(8) t from 1960 to 2007, and the average sediment retention of Xiaolangdi Reservoir was 2.398x10(8) t from 1997 to 2007.

The coastline near river mouth extended and the delta area increased when the ratio of accumulative sediment load and accumulative water discharge into the sea (SSC(T)) is 25.4-26.0 kg/m(3) in different time periods. However, the sharp decrease of water discharge and sediment load into the sea in recent years, especially the Yellow River into the sea at Qing 8, the entire Yellow River Delta has turned into erosion from siltation, and the time for a reversal of the state was about 1997.},

  abstract = {Policymakers in arid and semiarid basins face hard choices on water policies needed for adaptation to climate change. Hydro-economic modeling is a state-of-the art approach that can be used to guide the design and implementation of these policies in basins. A major gap in developments of hydro-economic modeling to date has been the weak integration of physically-based representations of water sources and uses such as the interaction between ground and surface water resources, to inform complex basin scale policy choices. This paper presents an integrated hydro-economic modeling framework to address this gap with application to an important and complex river basin in Spain, the Jucar basin, for the assessment of a range of climate change scenarios and policy choices. Results indicate that in absence of adequate policies protecting water resources and natural ecosystems, water users will strategically deplete reservoirs, aquifers and river flows for short-term adaptation to climate change, disregarding the impacts on the environment and future human activities. These impacts can be addressed by implementing sustainable management policies. However, these policies could have disproportionate costs for some stakeholders groups, and their opposition may undermine attempts at sustainable policy. These tradeoffs among water policy choices are important guides to the design of policies aimed at basin-wide adaptation to climate change.},

The saline soil and groundwater depth data of the county in 1981 were obtained to serve as a historical reference. Electrical conductivity (EC) of 293 surface soil samples taken from 2 km x 2 km grids in 2007 and 40 soil profiles acquired in 2008 was analyzed and used for comparative mapping. Ordinary kriging was applied to predict EC at unobserved locations to derive the horizontal and vertical distribution patterns and variation of soil salinity. Groundwater table data from 22 observation wells in 2008 were collected and used as input for regression kriging to predict the maximum groundwater depth of the county in 2008. Changes in the groundwater level of Fengqiu County in 27 years from 1981 to 2008 was calculated. Two quantitative criteria, the mean error or bias (ME) and the mean squared error (MSE), were computed to assess the estimation accuracy of the kriging predictions. The results demonstrated that the soil salinity in the upper soil layers decreased dramatically and the taxonomically defined saline soils were present only in a few micro-landscapes after 27 years. Presently, the soils with relatively elevated salt content were mainly distributed in depressions along the Yellow River bed. The reduction in surface soil salinity corresponded to the locations with deepened maximum groundwater depth. It could be concluded that groundwater table recession allowed water to move deeper into the soil profile, transporting salts with it, and thus played an important role in reducing soil salinity in this region. Accumulation of salts in the soil profiles at various depths below the surface indicated that secondary soil salinization would occur when the groundwater was not controlled at a safe depth.},

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents a case study centred on the Murrumbidgee River basin in eastern Australia. It illustrates the dynamics of the balance between water extraction and use for food production, and efforts to mitigate and reverse consequent degradation of the riparian environment. In particular, the paper traces the history of a pendulum swing between an exclusive focus on agricultural development and food production in the initial stages and its attendant socio-economic benefits, followed by the gradual realization of the adverse environmental impacts, subsequent efforts to mitigate these with the use of remedial measures, and ultimately concerted efforts and externally imposed solutions to restore environmental health and ecosystem services. The 100-year history of development within the Murrumbidgee is divided into four eras, each underpinned by the dominance of different values and norms and turning points characterized by their changes. The various stages of development can be characterized by the dominance, in turn, of infrastructure systems, policy frameworks, economic instruments, and technological solutions. The paper argues that, to avoid these costly pendulum swings, management needs to be underpinned by long-term coupled socio-hydrologic system models that explicitly include the two-way coupling between human and hydrological systems, including the slow evolution of human values and norms relating to water and the environment. Such coupled human\textendash water system models can provide insights into dominant controls of the trajectory of their co-evolution in a given system, and can also be used to interpret patterns of co-evolution of such coupled systems in different places across gradients of climatic, socio-economic and socio-cultural conditions, and in this way to help develop generalizable understanding.},

To address this question we consider a network of rational agents who independently accumulate private evidence that triggers a decision upon reaching a threshold. When seen by the whole network, the first agent's choice initiates a wave of new decisions; later decisions have less impact. In heterogeneous networks, first decisions are made quickly by impulsive individuals who need little evidence to make a choice but, even when wrong, can reveal the correct options to nearly everyone else. We conclude that groups comprised of diverse individuals can make more efficient decisions than homogenous ones.},

  abstract = {Gully head erosion is a significant process in semi-arid regions contributing to land degradation and hillslope dynamics. Predicting when and where gully heads will expand under different seasonal scenarios is an essential step to take the appropriate mitigation measures. The LANDPLANER model was applied in this study area in order to analyze and investigate specific issues related to the triggering of gully head processes. The model is mainly designed to describe the dynamic response of slopes (or basins) under changing scenarios, including meteorological factors, vegetation or land use, and slope morphology. This model enabled us to predict the occurrence of gully heads under different seasonal conditions defined by Curve Number and rainfall scenarios. The LANDPLANER erosion modeling schema is twofold and integrates two different approaches. The first is empirical and exploits an erosion topographic threshold equation, while the second is aimed to define an erosion index calculated starting from the results of the hydrological model. These two indices predict where erosion processes can occur. To analyze the impact of land use changes on slope response to rainfall events, we simulated seasonal land use changes scenarios, modifying the Curve Number values associated to each specific land use classes. The twofold strategy was also adopted to validate the model, namely testing the model with synthetic dataset, and applying the model to real cases. The results indicated that the density of gully heads is more frequent in the South facing slopes with low elevation (around 200-300 m), steeper slope (within 20-40 degrees), and higher average accumulation value ( {$>$} 100 m). Higher values of topographic threshold and erosion index (region 1: 13.1, region 2: 8.9) are obtained for the cold season in winter, where rainfall is intense and vegetation cover is lowest in the rangelands. Given to both observing receiver operating characteristic curve, the best and worst performances of gully head occurrence belong to the third Curve Number scenario (the lowest vegetation cover in terms of rangelands in winter) and the second Curve Number scenario (the lowest vegetation covers in terms of agricultural lands in summer) in turn. Further, the LANDPLANNER model effectively characterizes the status and trend of gully head formation in the study area.},

Despite their ubiquity, the general mechanisms that explain the creation and endurance of such hierarchies are not well understood. We introduce a generative model for the dynamics of hierarchies using time-varying networks, in which new links are formed based on the preferences of nodes in the current network and old links are forgotten over time. The model produces a range of hierarchical structures, ranging from egalitarianism to bistable hierarchies, and we derive critical points that separate these regimes in the limit of long system memory. Importantly, our model supports statistical inference, allowing for a principled comparison of generative mechanisms using data. We apply the model to study hierarchical structures in empirical data on hiring patterns among mathematicians, dominance relations among parakeets, and friendships among members of a fraternity, observing several persistent patterns as well as interpretable differences in the generative mechanisms favored by each. Our work contributes to the growing literature on statistically grounded models of time-varying networks.},

It is found that for the top 20th percentile of countries in terms of growth in U.S multinational affiliate value added, as much as 8.6\% of that growth between 1999 and 2003 can be attributed to declining relative stringency and enforcement of environmental policy. The results are robust to a number of identification tests, weak IV tests, and third country spatial effects.

In all cases, a serial position function was observed: People were more accurate to order the youngest and oldest actors, the lightest and heaviest animals, the shortest and tallest basketball players, the smallest and largest countries, and the smallest and largest planets, relative to intermediate items, The results support an explanation of serial position functions based on relative distinctiveness, which predicts that serial position functions will be observed whenever a set of items can be sensibly ordered along a particular dimension. The serial position function arises because the first and last items enjoy a benefit of having no competitors on 1 side and therefore have enhanced distinctiveness relative to mid dimension items, which suffer by having many competitors on both sides.},

  abstract = {The conflict of the human-water relationships (HWR) has further increased the water-related risks, such as water environment deterioration, water shortages, and even regional violent conflicts for obtaining usable water resources. Knowing how to evaluate and regulate the discordant HWR to form a balanced growth between sustainable socio-economy and water resources protection has become a critical issue in water resources management. The harmony theory method, which provides a new perspective for solving the conflict between humans and water, has been widely used in current studies. However, this method focuses less on the quantitative study of the balance status of HWR. This study proposes a harmony theory-based HWR evaluation method that contains a systematic process of harmony assessment, indicator identification, harmony balance constraints, and harmony regulation for assessing and regulating the discordant HWR. The Henan Province of China, which has a complicated HWR, was selected as a case study to apply and verify the approach proposed in this study. The results indicated that (1) Henan Province showed a poor harmony status. The human\textendash water harmony degree of 18 distinctions in the province varied from 0.41 to 0.76, showing an increasing trend from 2006 to 2018, indicating that the HWR was gradually improving in recent years. (2) The human\textendash water harmony degree showed that HWR in the southwest part of Henan Province, with less human activities, was better than that in its northeast part, which had faster social development. Sanmenxia City, located in the west part of the province, had the highest human\textendash water harmony degree because of the recent water control projects implemented in the city, indicating that human production measures could effectively help improve HWR. (3) At present, Henan Province has serious discordant indicators in these three aspects (water system health, humanistic system development, and human-water system coordination), which proves that it is still facing pressure from both socio-economy sustainable development and water resources protection. Our results provide insight into water resources management in Henan Province and other similar regions.},

Atmospheric moisture recycling \textendash{} the process of water evaporating from land, flowing through the atmosphere, and falling out again as precipitation over land \textendash{} is the invisible mechanism by which water influences resilience, that is the capacity to persist, adapt, and transform. Through land-use change, mainly by agricultural expansion, humans are destabilizing and modifying moisture recycling and precipitation patterns across the world. Here, we provide an overview of how moisture recycling changes may threaten tropical forests, dryland ecosystems, agriculture production, river flows, and water supplies in megacities, and review the budding literature that explores possibilities to more consciously manage and govern moisture recycling. Novel concepts such as the precipitationshed allows for the source region of precipitation to be understood, addressed and incorporated in existing water resources tools and sustainability frameworks. We conclude that achieving water security and resilience requires that we understand the implications of human influence on moisture recycling, and that new research is paving the way for future possibilities to manage and mitigate potentially catastrophic effects of land use and water system change.},

Massive anthropogenic landscape transformation from the later Neolithic into the early Dynastic periods, especially in the Chinese Loess Plateau, increased sedimentation in the Yellow River requiring intensive investment in flood control features to protect an ever-growing population. As the Yellow River channel aggraded, channel gradients became increasingly steep, and avulsions occurred with greater frequency and consequence. Flooding reached an apogee in the first decades of the Common Era when a massive avulsion of the Yellow River ca. 14-17 CE caused the river to shift to the south and east of its former channel. This avulsion and the catastrophic flooding that followed triggered the collapse of the Western Han dynasty. The Yellow River - known as China's Tribulation' - has been seen as a natural scourge that afflicts the inhabitants of the fertile North China Plain. However, when viewed in an Anthropocene perspective, it is evident that China's Tribulation largely is the result of human manipulation of the environment.},

In recent years, geoarchaeological research has branched out to encompass larger geographic scales, and to play a greater role in environmental archaeological investigations. This paper argues that geoarchaeology has a great deal to contribute to the understanding of human history and to archaeological theory through the application of multiscalar approaches that place human behavior in a physical, environmental and ecological context and by creating linkages between physical processes and human responses. We use geoarchaeological data from the Yellow River valley to show that drainage/irrigation canal and bank/levee building had commenced in the lower reaches by ca. 2900-2700 cal B.P. The emphasis on flood plain flood control infrastructure was a result of long-term increases in sedimentation caused by large populations farming with increasingly efficient technologies in the fragile environments of the Loess Plateau. Ever increasing sedimentation set in motion a cycle of further investment in flood control works eventually leading to a massive flood catastrophe in the first 20 years of the first millennium A.D. as the Yellow River exceeded natural and human geomorphic thresholds that constrained it in its previous course. These floods arguably triggered the social and political events that brought down the Western Han Dynasty but the root causes are clearly more complex. Geoarchaeology thus contributes to an understanding of the multiple causes and consequences of large-scale social and political collapse.},

  abstract = {Worldwide water governance failures undermine effective water management under uncertainty and change. Overcoming these failures requires employing more adaptive, resilient water management approaches; yet, while scholars have advance theory of what adaptive, resilient approaches should be, there is little empirical evidence to support those normative propositions. To fill this gap, we reviewed the literature to derive theorized characteristics of adaptive, resilient water governance including knowledge generation and use, participation, clear rules for water use, and incorporating nonstationarity. Then, using interviews and documentary analysis focused on five U.S. states' allocation and planning approaches, we examined empirically if embodying these characteristics made states more (or less) adaptive and resilient in practice. We found that adaptive, resilient water governance requires not just possessing these characteristics but combining and building on them. That is, adaptive, resilient water governance requires well-funded, transparent knowledge systems combined with broad, multilevel participatory processes that support learning, strong institutional arrangements that establish authorities and rules and that allow flexibility as conditions change, and resources for integrated planning and allocation. We also found that difficulty incorporating climate change or altering existing water governance paradigms and inadequate funding of water programs undermine adaptive, resilient governance.},

Interregional ES flows \textendash{} ecosystem services ``imported'' from and ``exported'' to other countries \textendash{} are rarely analyzed and their importance for global sustainability is little known. Here, we provide a first multi-ES quantification of a nation's use of ES from abroad. We focus on ES flows that benefit the population in Germany but are supplied outside German territory. We employ a conceptual framework recently developed to systematically quantify interregional ES flows. We address four types of interregional ES flows with: (i) biophysical flows of traded goods: cocoa import for consumption; (ii) flows mediated by migratory species: migration of birds providing pest control; (iii) passive biophysical flows: flood control along transboundary watersheds; and (iv) information flows: China's giant panda loan to the Berlin Zoo. We determined that: (i) Ivory Coast and Ghana alone supply around 53\% of Germany's cocoa while major negative consequences for biodiversity occurred in Cameroon and Ecuador; (ii) Africa\textasciiacute s humid and sub-humid climate zones are important habitats for the majority of migratory bird species that provide natural pest control services in agricultural areas in Germany; (iii) Upstream watersheds outside the country add an additional 64\% flood regulation services nationally, while Germany exports 40\% of flood regulation services in neighboring, downstream countries; (iv) Information flows transported by the pandas were mainly related to political aspects and - contrary to our expectations - considerably less on biological and natural aspects. We discuss the implications of these results for international resource management policy and governance.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about inland surface water distribution and its short- to long-term variability is of high importance. Recently many studies have presented interesting results at regional, continental and global scale with 14.25 m to 25 km spatial and 10 day to one year temporal resolution. However, surface inland water bodies can feature temporally rapid spatial changes caused by extreme events, seasonal variability as well as human activity. Such changes can occur on temporal scales which are below the currently existing dynamic water body products. While the daily temporal resolution of available sensors has not been exploited yet. In this study we present an approach which uses the full temporal resolution of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) to generate a 250 m daily global dataset of inland water bodies based on spectral information and dynamic thresholding. Based on a combination of MODIS Terra and Aqua daily classifications, auxiliary mask layers and temporal interpolation, a global cloud and gap free time series of inland water bodies is produced. The presented results are validated with 321 Landsat images across the globe. The executed validation shows an overall accuracy of 96.3\% with 7.8\% omission and 0.5\% commission error, and a kappa coefficient of 93.3\% for pure water pixels. The presented results demonstrate the high potential for different applications requiring information of inland water body dynamics at high temporal resolution. Examples demonstrate that e.g. the filling and emptying of water reservoirs, changes and inundation cycles of natural water bodies as well as freezing and thawing of lakes can be analyzed at a highly detailed temporal scale.},

To restore and preserve riverine environments, human societies have established water governance and management responses. However, the means by which a satisfactory environmental state can be achieved in light of different regional contexts is still poorly understood. This article explores whether or not good environmental performance can be achieved through water governance and management in combination with further context factors. To this end, we applied fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to examine data on water governance, water management, and environmental performance from a recent international study together with context data on per capita income, corruption, hydro-climate, and use pressure from other datasets. Results demonstrate that the combination of polycentric governance, high per capita income, and low levels of corruption is sufficient for achieving good water management practice. However, a good environmental state in river basins seems to primarily depend upon the overall level of pressure from human use rather than the quality of water management. This demonstrates that water governance and management should be seen as part of a broader societal transformation towards sustainability that focusses on a reduction of pressures in river basins instead of mitigating their impacts.},

The article formulates tools to conceptualize some of the ways in which `selection' and `adaptation' operate at every level to bring genes, cultures, states, and market exchange into provisional alignment with one another. It considers some of the ways in which modes of production', `modes of coercion' and `modes of persuasion' interact complexly, at different societal levels.},

Much of the early work in sociohydrology involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins) dealing with phenomena that involved emergent patterns in the time domain, with a focus on formulating and testing hypotheses about how they arise. The papers collected in this Special Section ``Sociohydrology: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Coupled Human-Water Systems'' illustrate that the scientific scope of sociohydrology has broadened over the last few years, with a rich diversity of phenomena studied and an expansion of the knowledge foundations and methodologies applied. These Special Section papers now incorporate methodologies and approaches from a wide range of social science disciplines, including anthropology, complex systems, economics, and sociology. The major themes tackled by these papers are understanding (i) water metabolism\textemdash the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and floods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and management. These collected papers provide a foundation for future research that strives to understand how to achieve water resources sustainability (society to water) and reduce the risk of hydrological hazards in society (water to society). Going forward, we suggest that the development of a common sociohydrology framework will be paramount for research development and student training. Additionally, increased engagement with the broader water management communities will enhance sociohydrology understanding and impact.},

An annual water-sediment regulation scheme (WSRS) was then implemented, aimed at flood control, sediment reduction, regulated water supply, and power generation. This study examines the eco-environmental and socioenvironmental impacts of Xiaolangdi Reservoir. In retrospect, it is found that the reservoir construction phase incurred huge financial cost and required large-scale human resettlement. Subsequent reservoir operations affected the local geological environment, downstream riverbed erosion, evolution of the Yellow River delta, water quality, and aquatic biodiversity. Lessons from the impact assessment of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir are summarized as follows: (1) The construction of large reservoirs is not merely an engineering challenge but must also be viewed in terms of resource exploitation, environmental protection, and social development; (2) long-term systems for monitoring large reservoirs should be established, and decision makers involved at national policy and planning levels must be prepared to react quickly to the changing impact of large reservoirs; and (3) the key to solving sedimentation in the LYR is not Xiaolangdi Reservoir but instead soil conservation in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin. Proper assessment of the impacts of large reservoirs will help promote development strategies that enhance the long-term sustainability of dam projects.},

  abstract = {Long-term data from a hydrological monitoring station and remotely-sensed satellite images were used to explore the effects of runoff and suspended sediment load on evolution of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) from 1983 to 2011. During this period, an average runoff of 18 x 10(9) m(3) yr(-1) and an average sediment load of 341 x 10(6) t yr(-1) flowed through the delta lobes into the sea. The runoff and sediment load exhibited downward trends with time, along with large inter-annual fluctuations. Three stages were evident in the data. From 1983 to the late 1990s, the Yellow River experienced progressively severe droughts which reduced both runoff and sediment load to its delta lobe. The delta nevertheless grew to a peak area of about 3950 km(2) in 2000. From 2000 to 2003, the YRD area decreased. Meanwhile, the operation of the dam at Xiaolangdi and changes in water consumption driven by a new regulatory framework helped stabilize the runoff. Although the sediment load continued to decline, partly due to sediment check dams along the middle Yellow River and the reduced sediment carrying capacity of the river, the YRD area nevertheless increased between 2003 and 2011. The variations in runoff and sediment load directly influenced changes to the plan-form area, shoreline migration, and morphology of the YRD. From 1983 to 2011, the net land area of the delta increased by 248 km(2), its coastline extended by 36.45 km, and its shape became increasingly irregular due to the emergence of its delta lobes. In 1996, an artificial diversion altered the position of the 01_manuscript delta lobe from Qingshuigou to Qing 8. A stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that the YRD would have required average sediment loads of about 441 x 10(6) t yr(-1) before 1996 and 159 x 10(6) t yr(-1) after 1996 to maintain equilibrium.

Here, we propose that individuals are aggregates that preserve a measure of temporal integrity, i.e., ``propagate'' information from their past into their futures. We formalize this idea using information theory and graphical models. This mathematical formulation yields three principled and distinct forms of individuality\textemdash an organismal, a colonial, and a driven form\textemdash each of which varies in the degree of environmental dependence and inherited information. This approach can be thought of as a Gestalt approach to evolution where selection makes figure-ground (agent\textendash environment) distinctions using suitable information-theoretic lenses. A benefit of the approach is that it expands the scope of allowable individuals to include adaptive aggregations in systems that are multi-scale, highly distributed, and do not necessarily have physical boundaries such as cell walls or clonal somatic tissue. Such individuals might be visible to selection but hard to detect by observers without suitable measurement principles. The information theory of individuality allows for the identification of individuals at all levels of organization from molecular to cultural and provides a basis for testing assumptions about the natural scales of a system and argues for the importance of uncertainty reduction through coarse-graining in adaptive systems.},

We need to redesign institutions to be proactive, agile, and socially just when confronted with compound risks that have become increasingly likely. Image credit: Dave Cutler (artist). Because the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) emergency is a protracted crisis that entails waves of infections over several months, the pandemic will inevitably continue to collide with other social and environmental shocks and disruptions, leading to increased risk of compound disasters (1). Globally, we have seen both extended and acute periods of stress on social and government systems driven by the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other natural and social hazards. When coupled with economic shocks, political fragility, and conflicts, these multiple stressors become concurrent drivers of complex emergencies that severely challenge domestic and international emergency response. Such crises present a need to better understand compound risks and prioritize collaborative action\textemdash we need to address neglected risk assessment challenges around communication, funding, governance, and social justice (2). Thus, while the world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, we must draw on existing knowledge and frameworks to ensure that disaster risk management can address compounded risks. We must learn from the current crisis to prepare better resource-deployment strategies, governance directives, and policy responses.

  abstract = {Coastal regions are threatened by natural processes, such as erosion driven by storm surges and the effect of jetties, as well as by human behavior. The coastline of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) was monitored using the general high-tide line method, which combines Remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technology, using multi-spectral scanner (MSS), thematic mapper (TM), and enhanced thematic mapper plus (ETM+) images of the YRD from 1976 to 2014 as a data source. The results demonstrated that the shape and length of the YRD coastline has changed dramatically since 1976. The course of the Diaokouhe channel has resulted in mainly inland erosion in the north, and is primarily marine erosion; therefore, it was termed an erosion-type estuary. However, the coastline of the Qingshuigou course has moved seaward, demonstrating an accretion stage, and was therefore termed an accretion-type estuary. The coastline advanced forward before 1997 and shrank after 2003 in the southern part of the river mouth, which was due to the shift in the river mouth in 1996. It has continually extended outward in the northern part of the river mouth from 2003 onward. The coastline in the southern part of the river mouth has moved randomly, with the occurrence of both erosion and sedimentation caused by land reclamation and sea wave intrusion. In most cases, the coastline has extended offshore, especially in the northern part of the river mouth. The YRD coastline has changed frequently and rapidly from 1992 to 2014. The river mouth channel, river water and sediments, and precipitation were the major factors affecting the YRD. The YRD coastline was mainly in an accretion stage during flow periods. The erosion rate decreased and tended to be stable during a dry period. The coastline was basically stable when dry periods occurred over a long period. The location of Yellow River ports and sea erosion were the 01_manuscript factors driving coastline changes. The coastline was mainly influenced by the flow path of the Yellow River, with recent human activity also becoming a factor.},

Not only is the regime shift frequently triggered by human activity, but the responses of relevant actors to ecological dynamics are often crucial to the development and even existence of the regime shift. Here, we show that the dynamics of human behaviour in response to ecological changes can be crucial in determining the overall dynamics of the system. We find a social-ecological regime shift in a model of harvesters of a common-pool resource who avoid over-exploitation of the resource by social ostracism of non-complying harvesters. The regime shift, which can be triggered by several different drivers individually or also in combination, consists of a breakdown of the social norm, sudden collapse of co-operation and an over-exploitation of the resource. We use the approach of generalized modeling to study the robustness of the regime shift to uncertainty over the specific forms of model components such as the ostracism norm and the resource dynamics. Importantly, the regime shift in our model does not occur if the dynamics of harvester behaviour are not included in the model. Finally, we sketch some possible early warning signals for the social-ecological regime shifts we observe in the models.},

  abstract = {Land use management of forests and croplands mainly drives the vegetation greening in China. Vegetation greening strongly modulates the trade-off between carbon sequestration via photosynthesis and water loss from evapotranspiration (ET) at the terrestrial ecosystem (representing by ecosystem water use efficiency, WUE). The function of vegetation greening in terrestrial carbon sequestration is well known, but the impacts of water loss from ET caused by vegetation greening on WUE are often neglected. Here, the GIS-based Priestley-Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model was established to evaluate ET in China from 2001 to 2015, incorporating vegetation dynamics as a key component. To quantify the net effect of the ET caused by vegetation greening on WUE, we compared two different simulation scenarios: actual vegetation greening scenario and simulated without vegetation greening scenario. The results show that forests and croplands mainly contribute to the growth in GPP and NPP in China with annual rates of 2.53 gC{$\cdot$}m-2 yr-2 and 1.59 gC{$\cdot$}m-2 yr-2 from 2001 to 2015, respectively. With the increase of terrestrial carbon sequestration, the ET under actual vegetation greening scenario was generated 6.78~mm{$\cdot$}yr-1 more than that under simulated without vegetation greening scenario. But as a result of the negative impacts of vegetation physiological effect (elevated CO2 concentration and the decreased VPD) on ET, values of ET under two different scenarios all exhibited a decline trend from 2001 to 2015 with rates of -~2.04\% and -~3.63\%, respectively. Consequently, although the WUE under two different scenarios exhibited increased trends (6.44\%, actual vegetation dynamics scenario; 10.74\%, simulated without vegetation greening scenario), the ET caused by vegetation greening led to an obvious divergence between the WUE under two different scenarios. For better understanding the impacts of human activities on carbon and water cycles at the terrestrial ecosystem, it is necessary to take the water loss from ET caused by vegetation greening into consideration, which is crucial for enhancing the sustainability of future vegetation-related projects.},

But dramatic discoveries across China in the past 2 decades are challenging long-held views. From Manchuria in the north, to the Chengdu plain to the west, and to the coastal cities of the south, excavations are revealing a host of complex and distinct ancient cultures, each with its own artifacts and traditions. Striking carved faces found in Liangzhu are one example; other cultures developed enormous bronze statues, large stone ceremonial complexes, and a golden, whirling sun motif. Yellow River sites like Erlitou, believed since its discovery in 1959 to have been the long-lost first capital of China (see sidebar), remain key to understanding the first true urban centers in China. But other, far-flung cultures also contain the seeds of Chinese traditions. The cradle of Chinese civilization was long considered to be the region around the middle Yellow River. But older and complex cultures from far-flung corners of the modern nation are now telling a different story about the origin of Chinese culture.

  abstract = {Human populations have grown to such an extent that our species has become a dominant force on the planet, prompting geologists to begin applying the term Anthropocene to recognize the present moment. Many approaches seek to explain the past and future of human population growth, in the form of narratives and models. Some of the most influential models have parameters that cannot be precisely known but are estimated by expert opinion. Here we apply a unified model of ecology to provide a macroscale summary of the net effects of many microscale processes, using a minimal set of parameters that can be known. Our models match estimates of historic and prehistoric global human population numbers and provide predictions that correspond to some of the more complicated current models. In addition to fitting the data well they reveal that, amidst enormous complexity in our human and prehuman past, three key ecological discontinuities have occurred in turn: 1) becoming dominant competitors of large predators rather than their prey, 2) becoming mutualists with food species rather than acting as predators upon them, and 3) changing from a regime of uncontrolled population growth to one of controlled fertility instead. All three processes have been interlinked with cultural evolution and all three ushered in developments of the Anthropocene. Understanding the trajectories that have delivered us to this stage can help guide prudent paths into the future.},

This study develops a coupled agent\textendash hydrologic model to both capture and provide insights into the dynamics and patterns of real-world water management using the midstream area of the Heihe River Basin in northern China as a case study. Water consumption patterns, economic efficiency, and environmental externalities of three different management schemes, namely an administered scheme (AS), a surface-water market scheme (SWMS), and a surface-water\textendash groundwater market scheme (SGWMS) are evaluated. The results show that an agent's (irrigation district) behaviors under market schemes are determined by the difference between equilibrium price and pumping cost, related to water table depth. The annual total benefits are improved under market schemes, especially in dry years. Negative environmental effects of the market schemes do occur but are not significant. The travel time of groundwater corresponds to a delay longer than 2~months in upper agents' pumping influence on drawdown. In general, the proposed model application in this study addresses complex real-world management issues by presenting physically interpretable and verifiable outcomes, and therefore aids policymakers in decision making by providing a broader view of water management.},

Although there have been many studies involving sensitivity analysis, uncertainty fitting, and performance evaluation of SWAT model all over the world, identifying dominant parameters and confirming actual hydrological processes still remain essential for studying the effect of climate and land use change on the hydrological regime in some water-limited regions. We used hydro-climate and spatial geographical data of a watershed with an area of 3919 km(2), located on the Loess Plateau of China, to explore the suitable criterion to select parameters for running the model, and to elucidate the dominant ones that govern the hydrological processes for achieving the sound streamflow simulation. Our sensitivity analysis results showed that parameters not passing the sensitive check (p-value {$<$} 0.05) could play a significant role in hydrological simulation rather than only the parameters with p-value lower than 0.05, indicating that the common protocol is not appropriate for selecting parameters by sensitivity screening only. Superior performance of the rarely used parameter SOL\_BD was likely caused by a combination of lateral and vertical movement of water in the loess soils due to the run-on infiltration process that occurred for meso-scale watershed monthly streamflow modeling, contrasting with traditionally held infiltration excessive overland flow dominated runoff generation mechanisms that prevail on the Loess Plateau. Overall, the hydrological processes of meso-scale watershed in the region could be well simulated by the model though underestimates of monthly streamflow could occur. Simulated water balance results indicated that the evapotranspiration in the region was the 01_manuscript component leaving the watershed, accounting for 88.9\% of annual precipitation. Surface runoff contributed to 63.2\% of the streamflow, followed by lateral flow (36.6\%) and groundwater (0.2\%). Our research highlights the importance for selecting more appropriate parameters for distributed hydrological models, which could help modelers to better comprehend the meso-scale watershed runoff generation mechanism of the Loess Plateau and provide policy makers robust tool for developing sustainable watershed management planning in water-limited regions.},

In this long-term study, Landsat images from 1976 to 2018 were acquired, and the cloud processing platform of the Google Earth Engine was used for extraction of coastlines. On the basis of these coastlines, the area and accretion-erosion dynamics were analyzed. Then, after statistical analysis of the interannual and intra-annual variations in runoff and sediment, we discuss the relationship between the accretion-erosion dynamics and the annual runoff and sediment. The results show that (1) the coastline of the YRD lengthened first and then shortened, and the average annual growth rate was 1.48 km/a. (2) The land area of the YRD showed a significant accretionary trend before 1996, with an average annual growth rate of 28.60 km(2)/a. Then, the area gradually decreased from 1997 to 2001. After WSR was implemented in 2002, the accretion-erosion dynamics gradually became smooth, with an annual growth rate of 0.31 km(2)/a. (3) After WSR, the maximum annual sedimentation decreased by 79.70\%. The average annual sediment discharge accounted for only 6.69\% from November to March of the following year during the non-flood season. (4) With the continuous decrease in sediment discharge, the determination coefficient (R-2) between the cumulative accretion-erosion area of the estuary and the annual sedimentation decreased from 0.98 in 1976-1996 to 0.77 after 2002. Overall, although WSR has maintained a steady increase in delta land area, it cannot change the long-term decrease in the land area of the delta. The insights gained from our study can provide some references for related coastline research, and will be useful to science community and decision makers for coastal environmental monitoring, management, protection, and sustainable development of the YRD.},

To spatially evaluate landscape sustainability and its change in a rural landscape, the authors combined ecological and social components to develop an indicator system and a model based on information entropy. Four types of information entropy, namely, landscape service capability, landscape service demand, landscape vulnerability and landscape adaptation, were calculated using year-based information entropy to analyze the spatial-temporal differentiation of a rural ecosystem. Combined with the landscape composition and configuration indicators, the spatial and temporal differentiation of landscape sustainability was analyzed, and the effect of landscape structure on landscape sustainability was explored. Based on survey data from Mizhi County, Shaanxi Province, China from 2009 to 2014, the following results were obtained: (1) An analysis of entropy change could be used to evaluate landscape sustainability. (2) The carrying capacity of the complex ecosystem in the study area increased during the study period. (3) If the effect of landscape structure is not considered, then the landscape sustainability of the study area might be overestimated. Additionally, it was pointed out that the analysis of landscape sustainability through Boltzmann entropy also provides a new way to test and verify the research results in the future.},

  abstract = {Revegetation, especially afforestation, has served as an important tool for controlling desertification. However, revegetation in water-limited regions will inevitably reduce the water available for socio-economic systems, which is poorly considered in decision-making on sustainable ecosystem management. This paper proposed a framework to determine the threshold of vegetation productivity (i.e., ecosystem carrying capacity), corresponding to available water resources for ecosystems (i.e., annual precipitation minus water demand for socioeconomic systems) on the Loess Plateau. The average annual ecosystem carrying capacity (ECC) during 1982-2012 is 577 +/- 124 g Cm-2 yr(-1), with spatial gradients increasing from northwest to southeast. Vegetation in rocky mountain areas has the largest value of 833 +/- 200 g Cm-2 yr(-1). Factorial analysis suggests that changes in precipitation and human water use contributed to 55\% and 45\% of the multi-decadal changes in regional ECC, respectively. Meanwhile, due to revegetation, 26 counties on the Loess Plateau, mainly in the southeast and eastern parts, have exceeded the ECC threshold during the study period. An additional 138 counties have a high potential for water competition between the ecosystems and socio-economic systems. At the regional scale, there are 9 years (similar to 30\% of the study period) during which the ECC threshold has been exceeded, especially after 1997. Considering the climate change in the future and the growing demand for water in socioeconomic systems, the corresponding ECC threshold will increase by 6-36\%. We believe that these findings can provide reference for policy-makers to make decisions towards ecosystem sustainability while meeting human needs for water resources.},

Nevertheless, the study of thresholds on subwatershed and watershed scales remains scarce. Given this, we presented the critical rainfall that generated the outflows of subwatersheds and watersheds as the threshold of sediment-generating rainfall. On the basis of the observation of twelve nested topographical units at the Peijiamaogou watershed in the Loess Plateau of China, we fitted regression relationships between rainfall indexes (rainfall amount, maximum 30-min intensity, maximum 60-min intensity, rainfall amount multiply maximum 30-min intensity, and rainfall amount multiply maximum 60-min intensity) and the proportion of cumulative sediment yield to the total sediment yield. We determined the thresholds of sediment-generating rainfall and explored the variabilities of thresholds across different spatial scales. Moreover, the covering area proportion (CAP) with rainfall indexes higher than the thresholds was also employed as thresholds at the subwatershed and watershed scales. The thresholds of CAP for P and I-30 were 50.5\% and 47.6\% at the subwatershed scale, while 31.0\% and 30.3\% at the watershed scale. The thresholds of P and I-30 at the subwatershed scale were higher than those of hillslope scale, while the threshold of I-30 at the watershed scale was smaller compared to the other scales. In general, I-30 was viewed as the best threshold among single rainfall indexes across different spatial scales, while P was not recommended as a practical threshold. This study can improve the prediction accuracy of water erosion across different spatial scales and develop the spatial scale effect of sediment yield in the loess hilly areas.},

  abstract = {The variability of temperature extremes was widely discussed in the past few decades worldwide associated with global warming, which impacted the hydrological cycle and energy balance. In this study, on the basis of daily maximum and minimum air temperature at 62 meteorological stations in the Yellow River basin, the changes in 13 indices of temperature extremes recommended by the ETCCDI were investigated in the Yellow River basin from 1961 to 2011. Both cold extremes and warm extremes showed a warming trend, with a large proportion of stations having statistically significant trends for most temperature indices. Because of a faster increase in minimum temperature than maximum temperature, diurnal temperature range (DTR) has decreased by -0.07 C degrees/decade. For cold extremes indices, i.e. coldest night (TNn), coldest day (TXn), cool nights (TN10p), cool days (TX10p), frost day (FD) and icing day (ID), the trends during the period of 1961-2011 were 0.23 and 0.22 C degrees/decade, and -5.23, -3.31, -2.61 and -3.16 days/decade, respectively. For warm extremes, i.e. warmest night (TNx), warmest day (TXx), warm nights (TN90p), warm days (TX90p), warm spell duration index (WSDI) and growing season length (GSL), the trends were 0.20 and 0.21 C degrees/decade, and 3.80, 3.26, 2.93 and 4.81 days/decade, respectively. In general, the indices have the largest change magnitudes in the arid and semi-arid subregions, followed by the high-elevation sub-region, and the indices have the smallest changes in the eastern monsoon sub-region. Relationships between the changes in the temperature extremes and the changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulations were studied. Results show that the changes in the temperature extremes were consistent with the changes in the area and strength of Northern Hemisphere Subtropical High (NHSH) and Northern Hemisphere Polar Vortex (NHPV).

In this paper, we focused on a typical loess hilly-gully region (Wudinghe and Luhe River basins) and investigated the effects of SWC measures and climate variability on runoff during the period of 1961-2013, while the SWC measures were the 01_manuscript representative of human activities in this region. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test was used to analyze the changes of annual precipitation, air temperature, potential evapotranspiration (PET), and runoff. The analysis revealed the decrease in precipitation, significant rise in temperature, and remarkable runoff reduction with a rate of more than 0.4 mm per year. It was found that runoff capacity in this region also decreased. Using the change point detection methods, the abrupt change point of annual runoff series was found at 1970, and thus, the study period was divided into the baseline period (1961-1970) and changed period (1971-2013). A conceptual framework based on four statistical runoff methods was used for attribution analysis of runoff decline in the Wudinghe and Luhe River basins (-37.3 and -56.4\%, respectively). Results showed that runoff reduction can be explained by 85.2-90.3\% (83.3-85.7\%) with the SWC measures in the Wudinghe (Luhe) River basin while the remaining proportions were caused by climate variability. The findings suggested that the large-scale SWC measures demonstrated a dominant influence on runoff decline, and the change of precipitation extreme was also a promoting factor of the upward trending of SWC measures' contribution to runoff decline. This study enhances our understanding of runoff changes caused by SWC measures and climate variability in the typical semiarid region of Loess Plateau, China.},

  abstract = {Changes in streamflow and sediment runoffs would affect the reservoir's functional operation and the construction of soil and water conservation measures in China's Loess Plateau. In this study, the long-term changes in streamflow and sediment were analyzed for a 01_manuscript stem section of the middle Yellow River where the to-be-built large Guxian Reservoir is to be located. Results showed that both streamflow and sediment had significant downward trends with the rates of -9.4m(3)s(-1)yr(-1) and -16.8 million tyr(-1), respectively, during the period of 1961-2017. Using the range of variability approach, the change of streamflow regime in its postimpact period (1986-2017) was subjected to the moderate alteration, whereas the alteration of sediment regime was moderate and severe for the first (1980-1996) and second (1997-2017) postimpact periods. As an example, the attribution analyses of annual streamflow and sediment changes were conducted in a typical tributary catchment (Qingjian River) on the right bank of Guxian Reservoir. For the periods of 1980-2002 and 2003-2016, climate variability occupied the primary and secondary proportions to both streamflow and sediment reductions, respectively. Overall, human activities demonstrated the underlying contribution to the sharp declines of streamflow and sediment, accounting for 68\% and 74\%, respectively, during the period of 1980-2016. We suggest that, based on the operational life of warping dams (built on gully for mitigating gully erosion by raising the gully-bed step-by-step), there are risks of flash flood and high sediment concentration events in the future because the streamflow/sediment-reducing infrastructures may be damaged by extreme rainstorms and in turn become the flood and sediment amplifiers.},

Climate change and human disruption have been suggested as major causes of the flow reduction, but quantification of their relative contribution is challenging due to limited instrumental records and disturbance by dams. Here we use a basin-wide tree ring network to reconstruct the Yellow River flow for the past 1,200 years and show that the flow exhibits marked amplitude variations that are closely coupled to the hydrological mean state swings at multidecadal to centennial timescales. Recent flow should have increased to the highest level of the past 1,200 years if there were no human disruption. However, human activities have caused a loss of nearly half of natural flow since the late 1960s and are the 01_manuscript culprit for recent downstream flow reduction. Plain Language Summary Recent Yellow River flow reductions have had major impacts on China's economy and water policy. The short and heavily human-modified gauge records are unable to reveal natural flow variability now and in the past. Here we use tree rings to reconstruct long-term Yellow River flow, which enables an assessment of natural flow variability and the detection of human contributions to recent flow reductions. Our 1,200-year reconstruction reveals that under natural conditions the Yellow River flow should have increased markedly since the early twentieth century. However, the observed flow decreased since the late 1960s and such a decrease must be predominately caused by human interventions instead of climate change.},

Therefore, the efforts to monitor where land degradation has happened and to find out the causes are meaningful for land management and restoration. Arid regions such as Southern Africa have attracted many concerns on land degradation assessment. However, previous studies have neglected the impacts of rainfall variation and possible breakpoints. In this study, the Time Series Segment and Residual Trend (TSS-RESTREND) method was used to detect land degradation in southern Africa and to compare with linear regression, RESTREND methods. Using TSS-RESTREND, 73.22\% of the study area was found with vegetation controlled by precipitation, and 18.9\% of the study area was found with breakpoints detected. Besides, results demonstrated that these increasing, decreasing, unchanged, and indeterminate pixels respectively made up 21.32\%, 9.67\%, 42.23\%, and 26.78\% of the study area. By eliminating positive effects from precipitation and including negative effects from breakpoints, TSS-RESTREND highlighted the potential overestimate of improvement by the linear regression method and the underestimate of degradation by the linear regression and RESTREND methods. These results showed that the land degradation detection with TSS-RESTREND method is useful for land conservation and restoration.},

Evaluation studies common use measurements of soils, vegetation, hydrology and wildlife to evaluate the success of wetland restoration. In contrast, the diversity of macrobenthos and their relationships with environmental factors are often neglected. To better understand the success of wetland restoration, we examined the abundance and diversity of macrobenthos in different stages of a freshwater wetland restoration project in the Yellow River Delta in China, with reference to environmental factors that might explain macrobenthic patterns. Macrobenthic species richness and density were greater in the oldest restoration area versus the younger and no-treatment areas. Macrobenthic biomass, however, was greatest in the no-treatment area. The oldest restoration area had deeper water levels, lower salinities, softer and wetter soils, and higher soil organic, nitrogen and carbon contents, and these variables largely distinguished the macrobenthic samples in a CCA analysis. A combination of landscape position and recovery time (time since the restoration was implemented) likely explains the abiotic differences among restoration areas. We recommend an adaptive management strategy, guided by long-term monitoring and experiments, to improve the success of this and other wetland restoration projects.},

A potential contribution to solving this problem is thinning of forested catchments to increase runoff. This study uses a machine learning approach, random forest, to relate catchment annual runoff to a range of predictors including climate variables and catchment attributes, and to estimate runoff increases from forest thinning. This approach identifies important predictors and enables prediction. The most important predictor is 'ForestIndex' calculated from calibrated satellite imagery and providing a consistent surrogate measure of forest density. This approach estimates annual runoff and carefully assesses potential model predictability by three modes of cross-validation. Our approach leads to more accurate annual runoff predictions than linear regression and the Fu's model (e.g. reducing RMSE by 41\% and 63\% respectively). We provide an example to predict the change in annual runoff in response to forest reduction under certain rainfall scenarios. The predicted runoff increase varies greatly amongst catchments from zero to 60~mm per 5 unit ForestIndex reduction.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The water planetary boundary (PB) has attracted wide academic attention, but empirical water footprint research that accommodates local biophysical boundaries remains scarce. Here we develop two novel quantitative footprint indicators, the water exceedance footprint and the surplus water footprint. The first measures the amount of excessive water withdrawal (exceeded amount of water withdrawn against local water PBs) and the latter evaluates the potential of surplus water that can be sustainably utilised (amount of surplus water available within local water PBs). We quantify the extent to which demand for goods and services in Chinese provinces and cities are driving excessive withdrawal of local and global water resources. We investigate both territorial and consumption-based water withdrawal deficit and surplus against local water withdrawal PBs. We also trace how PB-exceeded water and surplus water are appropriated for producing certain commodities. In 2015, China's domestic water exceedance reaches 101 km3 while the total water exceedance footprint is 92 km3. We find that 47\% of domestic excessive water withdrawal is associated with interprovincial trade. Exceeded water transfers were dominated by agricultural trade from the drier North to the wetter South. A revised virtual water trade network informed by exceedance and surplus water footprint metrics could help address sustainability concerns that arise from the trade of water-intensive commodities. Our findings highlight that policy targets need to accommodate PB exceedance of both direct and virtual water use.},

The important goal and the most direct effect of ecological protection and restoration are the vegetation restoration, which emphasizes the maximum or minimum range of NDVI of different vegetation types under specific terrain conditions. Based on the data of NDVI and topographic factors in a stable ecosystem, this paper comprehensively used descriptive statistics, multiple regression with interaction terms and threshold regression to analyze the spatial distribution of vegetation and its relationship with elevation, slope and aspect in the Wanhuigou catchment on the Loess Plateau. It showed that the NDVI values were high in the northwest and low in the southeast, and were generally consistent with the distribution of elevation. The change of NDVI with the slope was large, but the change with the aspect was not obvious. Meanwhile, the effect of elevation on NDVI would be limited by slope, but would not be affected by aspect; the positive effect of slope on NDVI would also be limited by the elevation and aspect. In addition, the influence of topographic factors on NDVI was non-linear, i.e. there was a threshold effect and different types of vegetation require different topographic factor conditions. Therefore, by rationally arranging the growth areas of different types of vegetation in accordance with the laws of topographic factor conditions, ecological protection and restoration could be more targeted to help build a stable ecosystem in areas with severe soil erosion such as the Wanhuigou catchment.},

This study was carried out to investigate the suitability of groundwater for domestic and agricultural purposes in Yan'an City on the Chinese Loess Plateau and to assess its implications to sustainable groundwater management on the plateau. The index levels were compared with the threshold values established by the national and the WHO drinking water guidelines, and the suitability of groundwater for irrigation purposes was assessed using multiple agricultural water quality indicators. An entropy-weighted Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (entropy-weighted TOPSIS) was adopted for overall groundwater quality assessment. The results indicate that the study area is characterized by saline, hard, and slightly alkaline groundwater, mainly of the HCO3-Ca center dot Mg type, accompanied by some minor SO4 center dot Cl-Ca center dot Mg type. The dissolution of carbonates and gypsum and the leaching of soluble salts are important natural processes influencing the groundwater ion chemistry. The parameters TH, TDS, and SO4 (2-) are major indices, while Fe, Mn, F-, and NH4 (+) are minor contaminants affecting groundwater quality. The overall groundwater quality is generally acceptable for irrigation, and most of the water is suitable for drinking. Rainwater harvesting, water quality improvement programs, regular water quality monitoring, and multidisciplinary water research programs are suggested as measures for sustainable groundwater management on the Loess Plateau.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River basin is a typical semi-arid river basin in northern China. Serious water shortages have negative impacts on regional socioeconomic development. Recent years have witnessed changes in streamflow processes due to increasing human activities, such as agricultural activities and construction of dams and water reservoirs, and climatic changes, e.g. precipitation and temperature. This study attempts to investigate factors potentially driving changes in different streamflow components defined by different quantiles. The data used were daily streamflow data for the 1959-2005 period from 5 hydrological stations, daily precipitation and temperature data from 77 meteorological stations and data pertaining to cropland and large reservoirs. Results indicate a general decrease in streamflow across the Yellow River basin. Moreover significant decreasing streamflow has been observed in the middle and lower Yellow River basin with change points during the mid-1980s till the mid-1990s. The changes of cropland affect the streamflow components and also the cumulative effects on streamflow variations. Recent years have witnessed moderate cropland variations which result in moderate streamflow changes. Further, precipitation also plays a critical role in changes of streamflow components and human activities, i.e. cropland changes, temperature changes and building of water reservoirs, tend to have increasing impacts on hydrological processes across the Yellow River basin. This study provides a theoretical framework for the study of the hydrological effects of human activities and climatic changes on basins over the globe. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

With increasing human and livestock population, significant challenges are faced in providing safe and high quality animal and herbage products from grasslands in China. The family ranch is the basic management unit and production system in Inner Mongolia, north China. Animal populations are increasing, but the income of herders and grassland condition are not improving. There is a need for new management strategies to guide the future development of animal husbandry. Based on the results of demonstration experiments and surveys in Siziwang Banner, the StageONE Model developed for Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) project ``Sustainable Livestock Grazing Systems on Chinese Temperate Grasslands'' was used to simulate changes in management strategies in a typical whole farm system, in order to identify feasible, sustainable and profitable farm management strategies. A new management strategy, including lower stocking rates and increased use of feed supplement in winter and spring, was adopted in a small number of farms and compared with the typical farm using the StageONE model. The results show that the total actual energy intake of sheep in the new strategy is higher than under traditional management, and the net energy surplus is \textendash 0.36 MJ/sheep unit/d, which is lower than under traditional management. The new strategy, in which stocking rates are reduced by 14.1\%, also reduced methane emissions by 34.14\% and increased net income by 15.85\%. The simulation results suggest new ways for herders, companies and government to improve grassland management while increasing herders' net incomes.},

  abstract = {The head region of the Yellow River is the key area where climate change would affect the hydrological process, since it is in a high elevation and cold area. Temperature and precipitation are two important meteorologic factors influencing the hydrological process. In this study, runoff change was evaluated as a result of the hydrological process change and an evaluation of runoff response to the two factors was made. Data derived from the results of seven general circulation models (GCMs) under two intergovernmental panel on climate change scenarios (A2 and 132) were used as future climate scenarios. First, factual and future climate change is analyzed according to data observed and obtained from GCMs. It was found that temperature has been increasing since 1961 and would continue in the future. The change in future precipitation also showed an increasing tendency. Then, a distributed hydrologic model, taking into account the effect of snow and frozen soil, was developed based on observed data in order to investigate the impact of temperature and precipitation change on runoff. Simulated runoff corresponding to climate scenarios indicates that the runoff amount would change lightly before 2020 and then would decrease approximately 5\% per year. Analysis of runoff characteristics showed that runoff would increase in the dry season, resulting in relatively uniform distribution of seasonal runoff. Large variablility in annual runoff in the future implies a high probability and severity of flooding as well as droughts.},

It indicated that Zn, Se, B, Ba, Fe, Mn, Mo, Ni, V, Al, Li, Sr, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, and Pb were all detected in the surface waters. Compared to drinking water guidelines, the primary trace metal pollution components (Al, Fe, Se, B, Mn, and Zn) exceeded drinking water standards by 40.7\%, 14.8\%, 29.6\%, 25.9\%, 11.1\%, and 14.8\%, respectively. Except for one site that exhibited anomalous metal concentrations, landscape features of trace metals identified a uniform distribution of trace metals for all sample sites. The calculated mean value of Hazard Quotients (HQs) exceeded the USEPA's recommendations by a factor of 2.9times the threshold value. Primary sources of trace metals were associated with natural deposition, industrial and agrochemical processes, and a mixed source of both geogenic and anthropogenic origins.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive study using ecological engineering analysis was conducted on the influence of the hydrology process in the Yellow River Delta. It was found that water and sediment played an important role in the formation and maintenance of the estuarine wetland. Based on hydrological data (1950-2005), meteorological data (1954-2005) and landscape data produced from integrated Landsat TM images of the Yellow River Delta, the relationship among all the above factors has been analyzed. The results indicated that runoff, sediment discharge and the area of the reed marsh wetland, meadow wetland and tidal wetland had evidently decreased from 1986 to 2001. The runoff and sediment discharge into the Yellow River Delta at a rate of 200-300 x 10(8)m(3) and at 5-8 x 10(8) t, respectively, were probably the most optimal range for maintaining the stable wetland landscape pattern. Regression analysis and principal component analysis showed that there was a strong positive correlation between the area of wetland landscape and runoff, sediment discharge, whereas there was a negative correlation between the area and the temperature, and there was no significant trend with precipitation levels. The water and sediment discharge are the dominant variable factors of the wetland. Human activities also have an important influence on transformation of wetland types as well as wetland degradation. Therefore, with economic development, climate change and sustainable utilization of resources, great attention should be paid to the changes of natural landscape and their causes.

  abstract = {Conserving more soil water is of great importance to the sustainability of arid and semiarid orchards. Here we integrated fish-scale pits, semicircular mini-catchments for hill slope runoff collection, with mulches to test their effects on soil water storage in a 12-year-old dryland jujube orchard on the Loess Plateau of China, by using soil water measurements from April 2013 to November 2014. This experiment included four treatments: fish-scale pits with branch mulching (FB), fish-scale pits with straw mulching (FS), fish-scale pits without mulching (F), and bare land treatment (CK). Soil water was measured using the TRIME (R) - IPH time-domain reflectometer (TDR) tool in 20 cm intervals down to a depth of 180 cm, and was measured once every 2 weeks in the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons. The results showed that fish-scale pits with mulching were better in soil water conservation. Average soil water storage (SWS, for short) of FB at soil layer depths of 0-180 cm increased by 14.23\% (2013) and 21.81\% (2014), respectively, compared to CK, but only increased by 4.82\% (2013) and 5.34\% (2014), respectively, for the F treatment. The degree of soil water compensation, W-S, was employed here to represent to what extent soil water was recharged from precipitation at the end of the rainy season relative to that at the beginning of the rainy season. A positive (negative) W-S larger (lower) soil water content at the end of rainy season than at the beginning. For the treatment of FB, the values of W-S over the entire soil profile were greater than 0; for the treatment of F, negative values of W-S were observed in depths of 60-100 cm in both years. However, the bare land treatment showed negative values in depths of 40-180 cm. This indicated that integrating fish-scale pits with mulching could significantly increase soil water storage by increasing infiltration and decreasing evaporation, and it showed greater soil water storage and degree of soil water compensation compared to fish-scale pits alone. Since the branches used for mulching here were trimmed jujube branches, the cost of mulching materials was largely reduced. Therefore, integration of fish-scale pits with branch mulching is recommended in orchards for soil water conservation on the Loess Plateau and potentially for other regions.},

To investigate the characteristics and mechanism of lateral migration in the Xiaobeiganliu reach, the temporal and spatial variations in bankfull width and thalweg migration distance were identified during the continuous deposition period, quantitatively analyzing the effect of different boundary conditions on the lateral migration index. The reach-scale bankfull width decreased by 32\% from 1986 to 2001 because hyperconcentrated floods often occurred in this reach. The thalweg migration distance varied dramatically at cross-sections, with the maximum annual thalweg migration distance reaching 4290 m. The lateral migration index of the Xiaobeiganliu reach responded well to the upstream and downstream boundary conditions. The previous 3-year average water discharge and 4-year average sediment concentration at the upstream station were two key fluvial factors influencing lateral migration, with the relation being established between the lateral migration index and the two parameters. The Tongguan (TG) elevation was the key downstream boundary condition affecting thalweg migration, and a power function was proposed between the lateral migration index and the variations in annual TG elevation.},

  abstract = {Investigating the effects of climate change on transpiration (T) and evaporation (E) in natural and constructed grasslands is of theoretical and practical significance for vegetation restoration and water resource management in the Loess Plateau, China. In this study, a two-year field experiment was conducted in one natural (Imperata cylindrica plot) and two constructed grasslands (Pennisetum giganteum and Medicago sativa plots) in the semi-arid Loess Plateau. Hydrus-1D models were then established and validated to simulate T and E processes under scenarios combining climate characteristics in both future periods and different hydrological years. The results showed that under all climate scenarios, T in the natural grassland, and P. giganteum and M. sativa plots ranged from 63.7-179.3, 126.8-245.5, and 96.9-243.1 mm, respectively, while E ranged from 90.6-131.9, 68.7-92.8, and 70.4-92.4 mm, respectively. Both T and E showed a decreasing trend in the future periods, exhibiting the highest values in wet years and the lowest values in dry years. The effects of climate change on T were greater than that on E in all three grasslands. Of the studied grasslands, T of M. sativa plot exhibited the strongest response, followed by that in the natural grassland and P. giganteum plot. However, E of the natural grassland responded to the strongest degree, followed by that of the P. giganteum and M. sativa plots. Precipitation during the growing-season was the most dominant climatic factor affecting T and E, and was positively linearly related with T and E (P {$<$} 0.01) in all three grasslands. The conversion thresholds of precipitation for T-E dominance were 435.8, 149.4, and 253.3 mm for the natural grassland, and P. giganteum and M. sativa plots, respectively. In constructed grasslands, more water was lost through T than through E; hence, the T/ET ratios were high ( {$>$} 0.55). In contrast, T was high in the natural grassland only in conditions of sufficient precipitation; hence, the T/ET ratio was relatively lower (around 0.5). Precipitation distribution strongly affected the soil water supply, and the natural grassland was more efficient in maintaining soil water than the constructed grasslands. Our study not only improves our understanding of the hydrological processes and water budget under different grass restoration measures, but also provides valuable guidelines for the management of water resources and the restoration of ecological environment in the Loess Plateau.},

  abstract = {Groundwater is an important source of water supply and ecosystem resilience. However, limited information on spatio-temporal dynamics makes a complete assessment of available groundwater resources difficult, impairing sustainable water management. The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment mission (GRACE) has recently made this possible. In this study, we used the Yellow River Basin (YRB) as a model system to explore the use of spatio-temporal dynamics information about groundwater change derived from the GRACE datasets for regional groundwater management. While there was an overall decreasing trend (R-2 = 0.57) during the last 14 year, the groundwater storage over the whole basin decreased significantly (p {$<$} 0.0001, slope changed from - 0.0137 cm/month to - 0.0684 cm/month) since 2010 (2010-2016) and showed stronger fluctuations than the time before (2003-2009). The range and the standard deviation of groundwater storage change also increased in recent years especially after 2010. At the basin scale, locations which exhibited higher variabilities (large standard deviation) over time generally showed radical decrease of groundwater storage. The results indicated that groundwater depletion may reduce the aquifers' function for ecosystem resilience, thus posing risks to the ecosystem of the YRB and threatening its people to climate change and extreme events. Despite the overall trend, the changes were heterogeneous if looking at finer scales: spatially, there was a gradual decline of storage from west to east (e.g. the change in December 2016 was - 3.6, - 9.1 and - 25.8 cm for the upper, middle and lower reach, respectively); and temporally, the timeseries among the reaches were significantly different (p = 0.023). Our hotspot analysis also indicated the heterogeneity in groundwater decline across the basin and through the time. Additionally, it showed that human factors (e.g. groundwater consumption) become dominant in determining the groundwater change pattern over climatic variations. We therefore call for more attention to groundwater in developing sustainable water management strategies and suggest a closer cooperation of neighboring provinces in the YRB to have a reciprocal strategic plan for water regulation, protection, and management.},

  abstract = {Water is essential for the survival of plants, animals, and human beings. It is imperative to effectively manage and protect aquatic resources to sustain life on Earth. Small tributaries are an important water resource originating in mountain areas, they play an important role in river network evolution and water transmission and distribution. Snow and cloud cover cast shadows leading to misclassification in optical remote sensing images, especially in high-mountain regions. In this study, we effectively extract small and open-surface river information in the Upper Yellow River by fusing Sentinel-2 with 10 m resolution optical imagery corresponding to average discharge of the summer flood season and the 90 m digital elevation model (DEM) data. To effectively minimize the impact of the underlying surface, the study area was divided into five sub-regions according to underlying surface, terrain, and altitude features. We minimize the effects of cloud, snow, and shadow cover on the extracted river surface via a modified normalized difference water index (MNDWI), revised normalized difference water index (RNDWI), automated water extraction index (AWEI), and Otsu threshold method. Water index calculations and water element extractions are operated on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. The river network vectors derived from the DEM data are used as constraints to minimize background noise in the extraction results. The accuracy of extracted river widths is assessed using different statistical indicators such as the R-square (R-2) value, root mean square error (RMSE), mean bias error (MBE). The results show the integrity of the extracted small river surface by theRNDWIindex is optimal. Overall, the statistical evaluation indicates the accuracy of the extracted river widths is satisfactory. The effective river width that can be accurately extracted based on satellite images is three times the image resolution. Sentinel-2 MSI images with a spatial resolution of 10 m are used to find that the rivers over 30 m wide can be connectedly, accurately extracted with the proposed method. Results of this work can enrich the river width database in the northeast Tibetan Plateau and its boundary region. The river width information may provide a foundation for studying the spatiotemporal changes in channel geometry of river systems in high-mountain regions. They can also supplement the necessary characteristic river widths information for the river network in unmanned mountain areas, which is of great significance for the accurate simulation of the runoff process in the hydrological model.},

  abstract = {The water resource issue is one of the most significant problems in the Yellow River basin, and has received much attention from the public and government because of the dramatically decreased Yellow River streamflow in the last several years. In this study, oxygen isotopic compositions of bulk carbonates from Lake Kuhai in the headwaters of the Yellow River were evaluated as an indirect proxy of past Yellow River streamflow in order to place the recent flow reduction in a long-term context. The results indicated that delta 18O values of bulk carbonates from core KHC14-1 generally vary with changes in the Yellow River streamflows related to the precipitation/evaporation (temperature) ratio above the Tangnaihai hydrological station over the past 50 years. In general, the Yellow River streamflow in the headwaters area continued to decrease from the early 1980s to the late 1990s because of decreased precipitation and increased temperature. Then, the streamflow increased with enhancing precipitation over the last two decades. In addition, delta O-18 values of bulk carbonates in the Lake Kuhai core roughly correlate with the streamflows of the upper reaches of the Yellow River recorded by tree ring width over the past 800 years. The enriched delta O-18(BC) values showed that the precipitation/evaporation (P/E) ratio or streamflow was very low and the climate might be very dry in the middle of the 1400s CE in the headwaters of the Yellow River over the past 800 years. Our results suggested that changes in the P/E ratio or streamflow of the upper reaches of the Yellow River were dominated by variations in Indian Summer Monsoon precipitation over a long time scale, consistent with other records from the northeastern Tibetan Plateau.

  abstract = {The operation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir has significantly altered the flow and sediment regime of the Yellow River, which has led to rapid and long-distance channel incision in the Lower Yellow River. Variations in the channel incision depth and stage-discharge relationships were identified in the braided, transitional and meandering reaches based on the cross-sectional profiles at 91 sedimentation sections and hydrological data at hydrometric stations. The results show that the cumulative reach-scale channel incision depths in the braided, transitional and meandering reaches in response to upstream damming were 3.0 m, 2.5 m and 2.3 m, respectively. In addition, water levels at given discharges dramatically decreased at three hydrometric stations in the different reaches. The previous 5-year average incoming sediment coefficients are the key fluvial factor influencing the cumulative channel incision depth in the Lower Yellow River. The cumulative bank retreat width increased with the cumulative channel incision depth in the braided reach, and a linear function between these parameters was established. However, bank retreat occurred when the channel incision depths reached critical values in the transitional and meandering reaches. Empirical equations were established between the cumulative channel incision depth and the relative bed roughness in the braided and transitional reaches, and they indicate that the riverbed coarsening process can mitigate channel incision to some extent.},

The planetary boundaries (PBs) framework has emerged as a strong guardrail concept, even though its capacity to inform the development of absolute sustainability assessments and realistic policies remains unclear. In this paper, we present a current synthesis of the development of absolute environmental sustainability (AES) indicators and assessments informed by PBs. We firstly explore how PBs have been considered in AES research at different scales. We then present a critique of how consensus could be reached in standardising and harmonising the share of globally and locally allocated safe operating spaces. We argue that PBs must be linked to human consumption as the 01_manuscript socio-economic driver and that planetary concerns can only be addressed through a holistic perspective that encompasses global tele-connections. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for the future design of AES indicators and assessments informed by PBs.},

  abstract = {The application of dams built upstream will change the input conditions, including water and sediment, of downstream fluvial system, and destroy previous dynamic quasi-equilibrium reached by channel streamflow, so indispensable adjustments are necessary for downstream channel to adapt to the new water and sediment supply, leading the fluvial system to restore its previous equilibrium or reach a new equilibrium. Using about 50-year-long hydrological, sedimentary and cross-sectional data, temporal response processes of Toudaoguai cross-section located in the upper Yellow River to the operation of reservoirs built upstream are analyzed. The results show that the Toudaoguai cross-section change was influenced strongly by upstream reservoir operation and downstream channel bed armoring thereafter occurred gradually and extended to the reach below Sanhuhekou gauging station. Besides, median diameter of suspended sediment load experienced a three-stage change that is characterized by an increase at first, then a decrease and an increase again finally, which reflects the process of channel bed armoring that began at Qingtongxia reservoir and then gradually developed downstream to the reach below Sanhuhekou cross-section. Since the joint operation strategy of Longyangxia, Liujiaxia and Qingtongxia reservoirs was introduced in 1986, the three-stage change trend has become less evident than that in the time period between 1969 and 1986 when only Qingtongxia and Liupaxia reservoirs were put into operation alone. In addition, since 1987, the extent of lateral migration and thalweg elevation change at Toudaoguai cross-section has reduced dramatically, cross-sectional profile and location tended to be stable, which is beneficial to the normal living for local people.},

  abstract = {Under climate change, flash floods have become more frequent and severe, and are posing a danger to society, especially in the ungauged catchments. The objective of this paper, is to construct a simple and early warning system, serving for flash floods risk management in the ungauged catchments of the Loess Plateau in China, and offer a reference for flash flood warning in other areas in the world. Considering the absence of hydrological data in the ungauged catchments, the early warning system for flash floods is established by combining the regional or watershed isograms of hydrological parameters and local empirical formulas. Therein, rainfall and water stage/flow are used as warning indices for real-time risk estimation of flash flood. For early warning, the disaster water stage was first determined according to the protected objects (e.g., residents and buildings), namely the critical water stage. The critical flow (flow threshold), was calculated based on the water stage, and the established relationship between water stage and flow using the cross-sectional measured data. Then, according to the flow frequency curve of the design flood, the frequency of critical flow was ascertained. Assuming that the rainfall and the flood have the same frequency, the critical rainfall threshold was calculated through the design rainstorm with the same frequency of the design flood. Due to the critical rainfall threshold being sensitive with different soil conditions, the design flood and frequency curve of flood flow were calculated under different soil conditions, and thus the rainfall threshold was given under different soil condition for early warning of the flash flood disaster. Taking two sections in Zichang County (within the Loess Plateau) as an example, we set the rainfall and water stage/flow thresholds to trigger immediate or preparation signals for the migration of the population along the river. The application of this method to the 7.26 flood events in 2017 in China, shows that the early warning system is feasible. It is expected that this simple early warning system can provide early warnings of flash floods in ungauged catchments in the Loess Plateau and other similar areas.},

  abstract = {Extreme climate events often cause catastrophic damage to nature and human society. Therefore, regional assessments in various climates and geographic regions are needed for understanding the uncertainties of the change trends for extreme climate events. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial distribution and temporal trends of extreme precipitation and temperature events on the Loess Plateau of China during 1961-2007. Nine indicators (pq90, px5d, pint, pxcdd, pnl9, txq90, tnq10, tnfd, bchw90) were chosen to quantify extreme climate events, the Mann-Kendall method and linear trend analysis were used to test the change in trend and the magnitude, and inverse distance weighted interpolation was used to interpolate the spatial patterns. Results showed that most extreme climate indicators were spatially distributed with obvious gradients from the southeast to the northwest. Heavy rainfall threshold (pq90), greatest 5-day total rainfall (px5d), heavy rainfall days (pnl9) and cold-night threshold (tnq10) decreased from the southeast to the northwest, while simple daily rainfall intensity (pint), longest dry period (pxcdd) and number of frost days (tnfd) increased from the southeast to the northwest. Most stations had monotonic trends in extreme indicators during 1961-2007. However, the number of stations with significant trends varied greatly. Precipitation-based indicators showed more mixed patterns of change and few stations had significant trends. However, temperature-based indicators had more uniform changes and most stations had significant trends. Hot-day threshold (txq90) and cold-night threshold (tnq10), and the longest heatwave (txhw90) tended to increase while the number of frost days decreased since the 1960s on the Loess Plateau. Overall, extreme precipitation events did not change significantly; however, extreme temperature events became more severe and frequent. The results implied that extreme climate events on the Loess Plateau will continue to have adverse impacts, and adaptive measures should be considered for future ecological construction and agriculturally sustainable development.

The spatial distribution and temporal trend in ET0 are interpreted by Inverse Distance Weighted Interpolation and Mann-Kendall method, respectively. Results show that the annual mean ET0 is 1060.3 mm, the lowest and highest values are found in the southwest and northwest region due to the spatial distribution of climatic factors, respectively. ET0 has increased significantly due to the downward trend in relative humidity and upward trend in temperature on the Loess Plateau during 1961-2009. HadCM3 projects a continuous increase in ET0 in the 21st century and the upward trend will be more pronounced after 2050. Averaged over the two emission scenarios for the whole area, the projected increase are 4\%, 7\% and 12\% for the three periods 2011-2040, 2041-2070 and 2071-2099, respectively; the increase under A2 scenario are slightly greater than those under B2 scenario. An obvious gradient is detected for the projected increase in ET0 from northeast to southwest region in the 21st century. The increase in ET0 will possibly influence the water resource on the Loess in the 21st century and some countermeasures should be taken to reduce the adverse impacts. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Natural disasters impose huge uncertainty and loss to human lives and economic activities. Landslides are one disaster that has become more prevalent because of anthropogenic disturbances, such as land-cover changes, land degradation, and expansion of infrastructure. These are further exacerbated by more extreme precipitation due to climate change, which is predicted to trigger more landslides and threaten sustainable development in vulnerable regions. Although biodiversity conservation and development are often regarded as having a trade-off relationship, here we present a global analysis of the area with co-benefits, where conservation through expanding protection and reducing deforestation can not only benefit biodiversity but also reduce landslide risks to human society. High overlap exists between landslide susceptibility and areas of endemism for mammals, birds, and amphibians, which are mostly concentrated in mountain regions. We identified 247 mountain ranges as areas with high vulnerability, having both exceptional biodiversity and landslide risks, accounting for 25.8\% of the global mountainous areas. Another 31 biodiverse mountains are classified as future vulnerable mountains as they face increasing landslide risks because of predicted climate change and deforestation. None of these 278 mountains reach the Aichi Target 11 of 17\% coverage by protected areas. Of the 278 mountains, 52 need immediate actions because of high vulnerability, severe threats from future deforestation and precipitation extremes, low protection, and high-population density and anthropogenic activities. These actions include protected area expansion, forest conservation, and restoration where it could be a cost-effective way to reduce the risks of landslides.},

The analysis attempts to understand the multi-dimensionality of sustainability at the farm level and its relationship with physical-socio-economic-infrastructural-technological framework conditions in the context of the land set-aside program viz. the Grain for Green Project (GGP). We developed composite indices of sustainability and its environmental, economic and social dimensions using a principal component analysis (PCA)-based weighting scheme. Regression analyses were conducted to examine the relationship between the estimated sustainability indicators and the variables representing framework conditions of knowledge, demographics, resource endowment and production techniques. The stated analysis was conducted on a dataset collected by means of household surveys in 2014 in valleys and flood plain areas in Yanhe Township. Findings reveal hidden correlations among the indicators of environmental, economic, and social pillars of sustainability. The ratio of land under the conservation program to actual farmland emerged as a key determinant of overall agricultural sustainability and its social dimension, which reaches the maximum when the ratio is around 0.56 and 0.64, respectively. The results also show that there is need to balance off-farm and on-farm income diversification as well as highlight the role of women in ensuring the sustainability of farming households. The core achievement of the article is the definition of the thresholds for the land set-aside program and the identification of major determinants of agricultural sustainability in the rural Chinese context in particular and in rural farming communities in general.},

The trends and the beginning points (or abrupt changes) of these series are detected with Mann-Kendall test (M-K test) and its progressive application. The results show that there are similar trends for different stations. The annual natural runoff series, except for stations of Lanzhou, Hekouzhen, and Longmen, have a downward tendency at some stations whose beginning points of the trend or abrupt changes occurred in the early or mid 1990s. However their initial years of decrease are different. The decreasing trend of runoff has led to drying-up in lower reaches of the YRB, a water resources scarcity crisis, and a deterioration of the ecosystem. The reasons for the trends have been analyzed in this paper The trends of precipitation in the corresponding regions are similar to those of annual natural runoff It is an important aspect for runoff decrease. In addition, human activities have changed the hydrological cycle and lead to a reduction in runoff to a certain degree. Finally, two countermeasures for the runoff decrease are put forward. One is to develop water savings in irrigation regions, and the other is to plan South-to-North water transfer projects for the YRB. However the conflict between supply and demand will still exist for a long time because of the water scarcity in the future.},

However, it is unknown how these changes will affect freshwater ecosystems that are important to densely populated regions of Asia. High-resolution diatom records and other proxy data archived in lake sediment cores from the Chinese Loess Plateau allow the comparison of summer monsoon intensity, lake trophic status and aquatic ecosystem responses during warming periods over the past two millennia. Here we show that an abrupt shift towards eutrophic limnological conditions coincided with historical warming episodes(4,5), marked by increased wind intensity and summer monsoon rainfall leading to phosphorus-laden soil erosion and natural lake fertilization. In contrast, aerosol-affected Anthropocene warming catalysed a marked weakening in summer monsoon intensity leading to decreases in soil erosion and lake mixing. The recent warm period triggered a strikingly different aquatic ecosystem response with a limnological regime shift marked by turnover in diatom species composition now dominated by oligotrophic taxa, consistent with reductions in nutrient fertilization, reduced ice cover and increased thermal stratification(6). Anthropogenic aerosols have altered climate-monsoon dynamics that are unparalleled in the past similar to 2,000 years, ushering in a new ecological state.},

However, existing studies have not provided a comprehensive picture of how precipitation frequency and intensity respond to vegetation cover change. Therefore, this study took the Loess Plateau as a typical example, and used satellite-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and daily gridded climatic variables to assess the responses of precipitation dynamics to human-induced vegetation cover change. Results showed that the total precipitation amount exhibited little change at the regional scale, showing an upward but statistically insignificant (p {$>$} 0.05) trend of 7.6 mm/decade in the period 1982-2015. However, the frequency of precipitation with different intensities showed large variations over most of the Loess Plateau. The number of rainy days (light, moderate, heavy, very heavy and severe precipitation) increased in response to increased vegetation cover, especially in the central-eastern Loess Plateau. Anthropogenic land cover change is largely responsible for precipitation intensity changes. Additionally, this study also observed high spatially explicit heterogeneity in different precipitation intensities in response to vegetation cover change across the Loess Plateau. These findings provide some reference information for our understanding of precipitation frequency and intensity changes in response to regional vegetation cover change in the Loess Plateau.},

The results showed that the sediment concentration generally increased with the increasing rainfall intensity on slope scale. However, at watershed scale, a significant threshold phenomenon was observed for the effects of the rainfall intensity on the sediment concentration. When the rainfall intensity exceeds the threshold, the flood sediment concentration will no longer increase with the increase in the rainfall intensity. The rainfall intensity threshold increased with increasing vegetation coverage. The rainfall intensity threshold was 10-315 mm/h during 1956-31969, reached 20 mm/h from 1990 to 1997 and is approximately 40 mm/h at present. Due to a rainfall intensity of 10-315 mm/h almost happened every year, the vegetation did not change much from the 1950s to 1980s. Sediment yield mainly depends on soil erosion caused by surface flow, but the surface flow speed does not increase indefinitely with the increase in the flow discharge. Thus, the annual maximum sediment concentration of the tributaries in the loess area has been basically stable before the 1990s.},

  abstract = {Samples of one core in the Bohai Sea mud area (BSMA) were analyzed in grain size, magnetic susceptibility (MS), major minerals, foraminifera, ostracod, stable isotopes, and C-14 dating to reconstruct sedimentary environment and impact of the Yellow River sediments on deposition in the Bohai Sea during the last deglaciation. The central Bohai Sea was river mouth or swamp environment before 12.9 ka BP, when sediments with low MS values had high sand content. Appearance of two peat layers at 11.2 and 12.9 ka BP at Core M7-6 showed that seawater had not yet entered the central Bohai Sea, where the limnetic ostracod was frequently existed and foraminifera were hardly seen. Abundance and diversity of foraminifera began to increase sharply, while their oxygen and carbon isotopes became heavier from similar to 9.3 ka BP due to seawater entrance into the central Bohai Sea. Related to intrusion of the Yellow Sea Warm Current (YSWC) extension into the central Bohai Sea, oxygen and carbon isotopes reached the maximum at similar to 6.5 ka BP. MS values between 2.4 and 8.3 ka BP increased continually together with slow sedimentation rate, revealing that the impact of the Yellow River sediments was limited because of strong hydrodynamic condition and small sediment discharge, At the last 2.4 ka, the influence of the Yellow River reached the maximum due to large sediment discharge into the Bohai Sea. However, the BSMA had slow sedimentation rate compared with other mud areas in the Chinese marginal seas despite of its close distance from the Yellow River mouth, indicating that although the BSMA was the primary sink of the Yellow River sediments, most of the Yellow River sediments were deposited at other areas (e.g. deltaic areas and Shandong mud wedge).

  abstract = {Water scarcity in northern China has been a topic of concern in China for many years, but the increased frequency and duration of ``no-flow'' events in the Yellow River in the 1990s created a flurry of recent activity in the academic and policy arenas. These low-flow events severely disrupted the supply of irrigation water for agriculture in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and posed a substantial threat to farmers' livelihoods. Within a broader effort to assess farmers' vulnerability to water shortages, this qualitative research focuses on the coping mechanisms and adaptive strategies adopted by farming households in three villages in Shandong Province (Ma, Ding, and Xing). With increasing water stress and other stresses from land degradation and lack of market access, farmers' coping mechanisms have evolved, expanding from one-time adjustments to long-term adaptations, and switching focus from securing reliable water sources to improving irrigation efficiency and diversifying both on-farm and offfarm production. The three villages have different vulnerability profiles and adopted different patterns of adaptive processes that reveal the key roles played by community leaders and the early innovators. The research presented here contributes a temporal and dynamic dimension to the study of vulnerability which is largely missing from the current literature, and provides practical insights about how to improve farmers' adaptive capacities in the face of water shortages in northern China.},

  abstract = {Interactions between distant places are increasingly widespread and influential, often leading to unexpected outcomes with profound implications for sustainability. Numerous sustainability studies have been conducted within a particular place with little attention to the impacts of distant interactions on sustainability in multiple places. Although distant forces have been studied, they are usually treated as exogenous variables and feedbacks have rarely been considered. To understand and integrate various distant interactions better, we propose an integrated framework based on telecoupling, an umbrella concept that refers to socioeconomic and environmental interactions over distances. The concept of telecoupling is a logical extension of research on coupled human and natural systems, in which interactions occur within particular geographic locations. The telecoupling framework contains five major interrelated components, i.e., coupled human and natural systems, flows, agents, causes, and effects. We illustrate the framework using two examples of distant interactions associated with trade of agricultural commodities and invasive species, highlight the implications of the framework, and discuss research needs and approaches to move research on telecouplings forward. The framework can help to analyze system components and their interrelationships, identify research gaps, detect hidden costs and untapped benefits, provide a useful means to incorporate feedbacks as well as trade-offs and synergies across multiple systems (sending, receiving, and spillover systems), and improve the understanding of distant interactions and the effectiveness of policies for socioeconomic and environmental sustainability from local to global levels.},

  abstract = {Recent changes in hydrological processes and soil erosion in the Loess Plateau, China, are immediate responses to cropland abandonment for revegetation, which lead to a long-term decrease in runoff generation and soil erosion. However, detailed hydrological responses and soil erosion changes have not been clearly evaluated. In this study, two issues were focused on the plot scale. The first issue relates to changes in vegetation cover and soil properties during the early stages of revegetation. Given the occurrence of soil compaction, it was hypothesized that runoff increased during this period and the soil erosion did not significantly decline, even though vegetation increased. The second issue is the effect of scale on runoff and soil erosion. Three plot groups of three vegetation types and two restoration stages were established for comparative experiments. The results from these experiments confirmed that the soil compaction occurred during revegetation in this region. Greater runoff was produced in plot group that experienced both a longer restoration time and with higher vegetation cover (such as Groups 2 and 3 in this study) than that with a shorter restoration time and lower vegetation cover (Group 1). In addition, the total soil loss rates of all plot groups were rather low and did not significantly differ from each other. This indicates that a reduction in runoff generation and soil erosion, as a result of revegetation, was limited in the early stages of restoration following the cropland abandonment. With increasing plot area, the runoff coefficient decreased for the plot group with a longer revegetation time (Groups 2 and 3), but gently increased for the one with a shorter restoration time (Group 1). In Groups 2 and 3, soil loss rate decreased when plot area enlarged. In Group 1, it decreased before a plot area threshold of 18 m(2) was exceeded. However, the increase occurred when plot area crossed the threshold value. In conclusion, the high vegetation cover alone did not lead to reduction in the runoff coefficient during the early stages of revegetation. When evaluating hydrological and soil erosion responses to revegetation, the soil compaction processes should be considered. Additionally, the effect of scale on runoff and soil erosion was found to be dependent on restoration extent, and thus on restoration time. (C) 2011 Elsevier BY. All rights reserved.},

Assessing the relative contribution of the two factors on runoff changes can help the planners and managers to better formulate strategies and policies regarding regional water resources. In this work, using two typical sub-basins of the Yellow River as the study area, we first detected the trend and the breakpoint in the annual streamflow data with the Pettitt test during the period 1964-2011. Next, a Budyko-based climate elasticity model and a monthly hydrological model were employed as an integrated method to distinguish the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to the long-term changes in runoff. The results showed that a significant decline in the annual runoff occurred in the two sub-basins during the study period, and the abrupt change point in the annual runoff at the two subbasins both occurred in 1997. The conceptual hydrological model performed well in reproducing monthly runoff time series at the two sub-basins. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) between observed and simulated runoff during the validation period exceeds 0.83 for the two sub-basins. Climate elasticity method and hydrological model give consistent attribution results: human activities are the major drivers responsible for the decreased annual runoff in the Ten Great Gullies Basin. The relative contributions of climate change and human activities to the changes in the annual runoff were 22-32\% and 68-78\%, respectively.},

In this study, changes in land use and landscape fragmentation in the small Shanghuang watershed on the Loess Plateau were investigated by the combined use of remote sensing, GIS and landscape metrics. Land use classes were mapped and analyzed from a time series of maps and remotely sensed images that were ground truthed in 2008. Analyses of the data showed that land use had undergone substantial changes in this small watershed from 1982 to 2008, and these changes could be divided into three phases according to the change in the landscape matrix whereby the dominant land use was grassland (1982-1990), cropland (1990-2002) and forestland (2002-2008). During each phase, conversions between different land use types took place frequently, especially among cropland, orchards, grassland and forestland. Landscape fragmentation increased from 1982 to 1990 and then decreased from 1990 to 2008 as indicated by four landscape metrics. These changes in land use and landscape fragmentation in this small watershed were mainly controlled by human factors (land management, construction, population pressure, and government policy) rather than natural factors.},

  abstract = {Many systems on our planet are known to shift abruptly and irreversibly from one state to another when they are forced across a "tipping point," such as mass extinctions in ecological networks, cascading failures in infrastructure systems, and social convention changes in human and animal networks. Such a regime shift demonstrates a system's resilience that characterizes the ability of a system to adjust its activity to retain its basic functionality in the face of internal disturbances or external environmental changes. In the past 50 years, attention was almost exclusively given to low dimensional systems and calibration of their resilience functions and indicators of early warning signals without considerations for the interactions between the components. Only in recent years, taking advantages of the network theory and lavish real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the real-world complex networked multidimensional systems and their resilience function and early warning indicators. This report is devoted to a comprehensive review of resilience function and regime shift of complex systems in different domains, such as ecology, biology, social systems and infrastructure. We cover the related research about empirical observations, experimental studies, mathematical modeling, and theoretical analysis. We also discuss some ambiguous definitions, such as robustness, resilience, and stability.},

This study was conducted to investigate the effect of litter incorporation on the process of soil detachment on the Loess Plateau, China. Four common plant litters (Bothriochloa ischaemum L. Keng., Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb., Setaria viridis L. Beauv., and Artemisia capillaris Thunb.) were collected, then incorporated into the silt loam soil at five rates (0.1, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.3 kg m(-2)) on the basis of our field investigation. Twenty litter-soil treatments and one bare soil control were prepared. After 50 days of natural stabilization, 30 soil samples of each treatment were collected. We used a flume test to scour the soil samples under six flow shear stress conditions (5.66, 8.31, 12.21, 15.55, 19.15, and 22.11 Pa). The results showed that the different incorporated litter masses and morphological characteristics, such as litter tissue density (ranging from 0.52 to 0.68 g cm(-3)), length density (2.34 to 91.00 km m(-3)), surface area density (LSAD; 27.9 to 674.2 m(2) m(-3)), and volume ratio (0.003 to 0.050 m(3) m(-3)), caused varied soil detachment capacities (0.043 to 4.580 kg center dot m(-2)center dot s(-1)), rill erodibilities (0.051 to 0.237 s m(-1)), and critical shear stresses (2.02 to 6.83 Pa). The plant litter incorporated within the soil reduced the soil detachment capacities by 38\%-59\%, lowered the rill erodibilities by 32\%-46\%, and increased the critical shear stresses by 98\%-193\% compared with the bare soil control. The soil containing B. ischaemum (L.) Keng. litter was more resistant to erosion. By comparing different parameters, we found that the contact area between the litter and soil was the 01_manuscript factor affecting the soil detachment process. The soil erosion resistance increased with the increasing contact area between the soil and litter. Furthermore, the litter incorporation effect on rill erodibility can be comprehensively reflected by LSAD (R-2 = .93; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency = 0.79), which could be used to adjust the rill erodibility parameter in physical process-based soil erosion models.},

  abstract = {River channel change can be very sensitive to environmental change and human activities and it has been one of the 01_manuscript research topics in fluvial geomorphology. In this study, repeated channel geometric measurements were used to investigate the channel adjustment to water and sediment changes of the lower Yellow River in China in the past few decades. With a high sediment concentration and large variations of water discharge, the lower Yellow River has a much active channel in its form and location, which has hindered previous research efforts to study long-term differentiated erosion/deposition of different geomorphic units in the channel. In this study, we divided each of four typical channel across-sections at hydrological stations in the lower Yellow River into different units according to the geomorphological features, and give a detailed investigation of erosion/deposition processes of these geomorphic units and the interactions between them besides the influence of incoming water and sediment conditions. The results show that with a significant decreasing trend of both the annual runoff and sediment load of the river and abrupt changes in 1985-1996, the overall siltation trend in the river channel before 1990 had been replaced by a slight erosion trend after 2006. In the earlier period, the siltation in the upstream wandering and transitional reaches mainly occurred on floodplains and that in the downstream straight reaches principally on 01_manuscript channel bed. In the later period, erosion occurred mainly on high and low bank slopes in the wandering reaches and on 01_manuscript channel bed in the transitional reaches. The erosion became weak in the wandering reaches after 2010, continued in the transitional reaches, and was still relatively minor in the straight reaches, reflecting the downstream hysteresis channel response to changes in water and sediment discharges down dams. Our results suggest that the seasonal erosion/deposition of a geomorphic unit of the river channel can be attributed to the changes in water and sediment discharges as well as to the interaction between geomorphic units. Siltation on the 01_manuscript channel bed could be attributed to erosion on the bank slopes in both the sections in the wandering and transitional reaches, and erosion of the 01_manuscript channel bed in flood seasons was negatively related with the mean water discharge at the two sections in the straight reaches. This result implies that fixing the bank slopes in the wandering and transitional reaches and raising the water discharge in the straight reach in flood seasons are favorable options for controlling the development of the two-level perching channel of the lower Yellow River.},

This study investigated the changes in streamflow and sediment load from 1964 to 2012 in the Ten Great Gullies area of the Upper Yellow River. Tests for gradual trends (Mann-Kendall test) and abrupt changes (Pettitt test) identify that significant declines in streamflow and sediment load occurred in 1997-1998 in two typical gullies. A comparison of climatic variability before and after the change points shows no statistically significant trends in annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration. Human activities have been very active in the region and during 1990-2010, 146.01 and 197.62 km(2) of land were converted, respectively, to forests and grassland, with corresponding increases of 87.56 and 77.05\%. In addition, a large number of check dams have been built up in the upper reaches of the ten gullies. These measures were likely responsible for the significant decline in the annual streamflow and sediment load over the last 49 years.},

To investigate the eco-environmental benefits brought by the Grain for Green Program, the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover in the growing season from 2000 to 2010 across the Hekou-Longmen (He-Long) region were analyzed by using remote sensing information, meteorological data and land use data. Moreover, the impacts of climate and human activities on vegetation change were evaluated objectively. Annual vegetation cover in the growing season increased very significantly. Increased vegetation cover occurred in 98.7\% of the region, of which the area for vegetation cover improved slightly constituted 79.8\% of the whole area. Vegetation moderately improved was mainly distributed in the south of the He-Long region, covering 9.6\% of the area, and the area for vegetation basically unchanged concentrated in the middle and upper reaches of the Wuding River. Precipitation was found to be an important natural factor influencing vegetation cover change. The area of vegetation cover showing a significantly positive correlation with precipitation occupied 22.14\% of the region. As driven by policies from the Grain for Green Program, forestland increased significantly and land use structure became more intensive. Human activities played a positive and effective role in the protection, restoration and improvement of vegetation in the places where vegetation cover was basically unchanged, even though precipitation declined greatly, and vegetation improved moderately with massive increases of forestland and grassland.},

  abstract = {The cropland-to-apple orchard conversion is expanding in the semiarid Loess Plateau, yet its impacts on deep soil moisture and nitrate are poorly documented. This study was conducted in Luochuan, typically the best area for apple planting in China, where fifteen 6-m-deep soil profiles were sampled from each cropland (as the control), as well as 8-, 17- and 25-yr apple orchards, to investigate the vertical distributions of soil moisture and nitrate and their storage. Results showed that the 8-yr apple orchards were comparable to cropland in soil moisture content (SMC), soil water storage (SWS), soil nitrate concentration (SNC) and residual soil nitrate (RSN). In contrast, 17- and 25-yr apple orchards, caused serious SWS deficits, of 140 mm and 150 mm, and substantially increased RSN, by 4270 and 7250 kg N ha(-1), respectively, when compared with cropland. Notably, RSN in deep soils was strongly enhanced by the stand age of apple orchard, which was primarily associated with accumulated N fertilizer inputs. Similar SNCs in the 540-600 cm layer among land use types implied a 6-m-deep soil profile might be robust for evaluating NO3- dynamics following cropland-to-orchard conversion in the study region. Regression relationships between RSN and SWS were significantly positive in the 100-300 cm soil layer under cropland but significantly negative in the 0-100 cm and 100-300 cm layers under 8-yr apple orchards, indicating distinct hydrological processes of NO3- under differing land uses. In conclusion, converting cropland to apple orchards could result in soil moisture decline and nitrate accumulation in the 6-m profile that may threaten the Loess Plateau's sustainability. Therefore, integrated water and N management should be practiced to mitigate the unfavorable impacts and develop sustainable apple production in China and other semiarid areas of the world.},

Shoreline monitoring research has a vital role in managing and protecting coastal ecosystems and communities. This study focuses on measurements of morphological change in the Yellow River channel and the Yellow River Delta (YRD) shoreline during a 40-year period. The lower reaches of the Yellow River continuously changed because of silting, stretching, lifting, swinging, and avulsion, to ultimately, changing course. The location of the mouth of the Yellow River was directly influenced by the swinging and the artificial avulsion. Overall, the shoreline expanded seaward at a decreasing rate over time, but it exhibited distinctively different patterns in two subregions (Diaokou and Qingshuigou). The shoreline in Diaokou displayed a trend of retreating inland, whereas the shoreline in Qingshuigou expanded rapidly towards the sea. The rate of change was greatest near the river mouth. An upward trend in the shape index was found across the YRD and its subregions, reflecting the shoreline becoming more complex over time. Human activities will become an increasingly important factor affecting the development and evolution of the YRD. This study should be useful for coastal engineers, coastal managers, and policy makers in the YRD.},

  abstract = {China's water policies in the past decades have relied heavily on the construction of massive water conservancy projects in the form of dams and reservoirs, water transfer projects, and irrigation infrastructure. These facilities have brought tremendous economic and social benefits but also posed many adverse impacts on the eco-environment and society. With the intensification of water scarcity, China's future water conservancy development is facing tremendous challenge of supporting the continuous economic development while protecting the water resources and the dependent ecosystems. This paper provides an overview of China's water conservancy development, and illustrates the socioeconomic, environmental and ecological impacts. A narrative of attitude changes of the central government towards water conservancy, as well as key measures since the 1950s is presented. The strategic water resources management plan set by the central government in its Document No. 1 of 2011 is elaborated with focus on the three stringent controlling ``redlines'' concerning national water use, water use efficiency and water pollution and the huge investments poised to finance their implementation. We emphasize that realizing the goals set in the strategic plan requires paradigm shifts of the water conservancy development towards maximizing economic and natural capitals, prioritizing investment to preserve intact ecosystems and to restore degraded ecosystems, adapting climate change, balancing construction of new water projects and rejuvenation of existing projects, and managing both ``blue'' (surface/groundwater) and ``green'' water (soil water).},

Since the late 1980s, water scarcity research has attracted much political and public attention. We here review a variety of indicators that have been developed to capture different characteristics of water scarcity. Population, water availability, and water use are the key 01_manuscript of these indicators. Most of the progress made in the last few decades has been on the quantification of water availability and use by applying spatially explicit models. However, challenges remain on appropriate incorporation of green water (soil moisture), water quality, environmental flow requirements, globalization, and virtual water trade in water scarcity assessment. Meanwhile, inter- and intra-annual variability of water availability and use also calls for assessing the temporal dimension of water scarcity. It requires concerted efforts of hydrologists, economists, social scientists, and environmental scientists to develop integrated approaches to capture the multi-faceted nature of water scarcity.},

However, increasing shortages of water resources and the resulting problems, such as the drainage of groundwater, ground fracturing and land subsidence, have emerged gradually in some parts of these irrigation areas; this has posed a large challenge to local people and water authorities in past decades. As the most essential issue for these irrigation areas, the water source, its condition and crises were analyzed by taking the Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area as an example in this paper. Considering the minimum environmental instream flow in the Jinghe River with different methods, a reasonable value of the average annual available runoff was evaluated for the Jinghuiqu Irrigation Area, and the water shortage was evaluated by considering two different types of water usage based on hydrological analysis and statistics. The results indicate that the situation is not promising as a whole. For some dry years, the available runoff is lower than the average annual water requirements of the irrigation area, and moreover, the situation will become increasingly worse if the runoff in the Jinghe River decreases continuously, which has been its tendency for the past few decades. Based on the severe groundwater situation, surface water should always be given priority in irrigation, and irrigating with groundwater should be strictly prohibited during wet periods and restricted during normal and dry years in the whole area.},

The results showed that runoff appeared a significant decreasing trend (P = 0.01) while it was not significant in precipitation in all study areas. In particular, the reductions of average annual runoff in the Hekou-Longmen region, Huangfuchuan watershed, and Yanhe watershed were 72.7\%, 87.5\%, and 32.2\%, respectively, during 2000-2010 compared to the 1950s. There existed two abrupt change points of the runoff in the Hekou-Longmen region and Huangfuchuan watershed, which were detected in 1979 and 1998. But in the Yanhe watershed only one abrupt change point was found in 1996. The precipitation elasticities of runoff were 1.11, 1.09, and 1.26, respectively, and the contributions of precipitation on runoff reduction were 26.4\%, 17.9\%, and 31.6\%, respectively, in the Hekou-Longmen region, Huangfuchuan watershed, and Yanhe watershed.},

  abstract = {China has become the largest contributing country to global vegetation regreening. However, the regreening pattern and subsequent impact on arid areas have not been comprehensively evaluated. Therefore, we selected the Loess Plateau, a representative arid region that has undergone evident vegetation restoration, to investigate the spatial patterns and temporal trends, as well as the drivers of vegetation change. This study primarily focused on 12 afforested watersheds during 2000-2018. Furthermore, both the impacts of vegetation regreening on runoff for the past two decades and the future projections were quantified based on the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (fPAR), the Budyko model, and the global climate models (GCMs). fPAR for the last two decades indicates that vegetation in the Loess Plateau has experienced a continuous increasing trend during the growing season, primarily in response to the implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GFGP). Of the 12 watersheds, 9 experienced significant fPAR change with a change rate above 50\%, and 11 exhibited a significant increase (p {$<$} 0.05) in runoff sensitivity to vegetation regreening, which indicates that vegetation regreening plays an increasingly important role in controlling runoff variation. The decline in runoff caused by vegetation regreening was particularly noticeable before 2011 or 2012; afterwards, runoff tended to vary with precipitation. In the future (2020-2049 and 2050-2099), decrease in runoff by regreening will be limited, as runoff is anticipated to decrease by 3.5\% in 2020-2049 and 4.1\% in 2050-2099 with a 20\% increase in fPAR. These results indicate that runoff tends to be stable even with continuous vegetation regreening. While the reduction of runoff by regreening will be limited in the future, rapid human-induced vegetation regreening may aggravate water scarcity when flash droughts occur and may result in disasters in water-limited regions to the socio-economic stability and agriculture. Our study will provide an applicable theoretical foundation for water resources decision-making and ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River has caused suffering to people with its devastating floods throughout human history. Understanding the occurrence of Yellow River floods and their relationship with climate change is crucial for sustainable water governance in North China. Here we synthesize historical and climatic records in the Yellow River basin to investigate their relationship during the past two millennia. Based on historical archives of river floods and levee breaches, we developed a decadally resolved Yellow River flooding frequency record from 221 BCE to 1949 CE, which provides a rare chance to perceive the river's long-term flood dynamics. As revealed, the Yellow River flooding can be divided into two distinct stages: an early stage of low-frequency floods from the 220s BCE to the 890s CE; and a late stage of high-frequency floods during the 900s\textendash 1940s CE. A substantial increase in flooding frequency around the 10th century fell within the transition period into the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA), during which the Yellow River basin featured warm and wet climate conditions. Coincidentally, human management of the Yellow River intensified as a response to more severe and frequent floods. The intense river management persisted thereafter and resulted in the super-elevation of the riverbed, which made the river more prone to flooding. Consequently, the Yellow River flooding frequency remained high even after entering the Little Ice Age, during which the river basin featured cool temperature and reduced precipitation. Our study suggests that the dramatic transition from a previous cool, dry into a warm, wet climate during the MCA period triggered intense human management of river channels and the establishment of the flood-prone nature of the Yellow River.},

Using a framework developed by Turton, and a common set of characteristics describing key stages of water demand, we examine the effectiveness of isolated technical (e.g., irrigation upgrades) and allocative (e.g., buyback) efficiency for reducing water demand to sustainable levels. We base our analysis on Australia's water reform context which offers an advanced example of applying these levers to achieve allocative and technical efficiency. The study is motivated by appreciation of the benefits from increased policy flexibility and adaptability in response to the following: potential transformations toward inflexible production systems; uncertainty associated with impacts of climate change on future water reliability; and the need for increased possible future equity between uses/users (productive/consumptive, environmental, cultural). Our results highlight that a balance between technical and allocative efficiency mechanisms is necessary, as neither is sufficient in isolation, when seeking to reduce total water use. This approach also enables a clearer representation of uncertainty in future policy choices in many global settings with respect to water demand reduction.},

Trends and abrupt change points of the hydro-climatic variables in the Tao River Basin were investigated during 1956-2015. It also quantitatively separates the impacts of climate change and human activities on runoff change in the Tao River by using RCC-WBM model. Results indicate that temperature presented a significant rising trend (0.2 degrees C per decade) while precipitation exhibited an insignificant decreasing trend (3.8 mm per decade) during 1956-2015. Recorded runoff in the Tao River decreased significantly with a magnitude of -13.7 mm per decade and abrupt changes in 1968 and 1986 were identified. Relative to the baseline period (1956-1968), runoff in the two anthropogenic disturbed periods of 1969-1986 and 1987-2015 decreased by 27.8 mm and 76.5 mm, respectively, which can be attributed to human activities (accounting for 69\%) and climate change (accounting for 31\%). Human activities are the principal drivers of runoff reduction in the Tao River Basin. However, the absolute influences on runoff reductions by the both drivers tend to increase, from 7.7 mm in 1969-1986 to 24.4 mm in 1987-2015 by climate change and from 20.2 mm to 52.2 mm by human activities.},

  abstract = {The long-term viability of pastoralism has been a constant theme for discussions. The progress of knowledge on the sustainability of pastoralism under global environmental change has been notable in the last years. To better characterize this vulnerability, we have examined the existing scientific knowledge about the three dimensions of vulnerability, being exposure illustrated by the existing climate trends and non-climate transformations, sensitivity by the impacts of these on pastoral resources and pastoral land conversions, and adaptation by the adaptation strategies developed by the pastoral communities. A qualitative meta-analysis was conducted to explore patterns and trends across the literature. From this, six different pathways of vulnerability being followed by pastoral communities were identified: Encroachment, Re-greening, Customary, Polarization, Communal and No-alternative. The results point that the livelihood options of pastoralists are generally becoming narrower. Four major forces are identified as exerting determinant influence on the co-production of the vulnerability of pastoralism: (i) the double exposure to climate and non-climate transformations, (ii) the persistence of unfavorable development policies, (iii) the great vitality of adaptation, and (iv) the multifaceted role of markets. We point that it is crucial to distinguish between the component of vulnerability inherent in any economic activity devoted to the use of natural resources, which is the usual business of pastoralism, and the component of vulnerability linked to external forces that disturb the usual working of the pastoral production strategies.},

It is less well understood why and how communication affects cooperative behavior and whether that impact is mediated by the sharing of a common context and the individuals' every day experiences. This paper aims to close this gap by means of a systematic content analysis of communication transcripts from field experiments. The paper analyzes communication statements shared by participants in a series of common-pool resource experiments conducted in rural Colombia. We first classified each statement under two categories: topic and function. Then, we tested hypotheses about the impact of those statements on cooperation depending on (1) their reference to the ``field context'' and other topic categories; and (2) the ``informational'', ``disapproval'', or ``group solidarity'' function of the statements. According to our results, statements that contain references to the context affect cooperation depending on the function of those statements. When the statements fulfill an information role, the effect is negative, but when statements have the function of enhancing group solidarity, the effect is positive. The statements that have the strongest positive impact on cooperation are those fulfilling a disapproval function, particularly when the topic of the messages are the payoffs obtained by the group.},

We illustrate the utility of the framework by exploring how actors navigate institutional complexity to increase collective welfare and adaptive capacity in California's San Francisco Bay, in contrast with protecting self-interest and constraining adaptive capacity on Queensland's Great Barrier Reef. Our analysis provides: (1) a normative perspective on how institutional navigation may or may not support sustainability; (2) initial theoretical hypotheses about understudied strategies used by policy actors to advance or constrain sustainability; and (3) some practical ideas for policy actors seeking to strategically achieve complex sustainability goals in polycentric systems.},

  abstract = {Abstract. Information on global cropland distribution and agricultural production is critical for the world's agricultural monitoring and food security. We present datasets of cropland extent and agricultural production in the two-paper series of a cultivated planet in 2010. In the first part, we propose a new self-adapting statistics allocation model (SASAM) to develop the global map of cropland distribution. SASAM is based on the fusion of multiple existing cropland maps and multilevel statistics of the cropland area, which is independent of training samples. First, cropland area statistics are used to rank the input cropland maps, and then a scoring table is built to indicate the agreement among the input datasets. Secondly, statistics are allocated adaptively to the pixels with higher agreement scores, until the cumulative cropland area is close to the statistics. The multi-level allocation results are then integrated to obtain the extent of cropland. We applied SASAM to produce a global cropland synergy map with a 500\,m spatial resolution circa 2010. The accuracy assessments show that the synergy map has higher accuracy than the input datasets, and better consistency with the cropland statistics. The synergy cropland map is available via an open-data repository (DOI: https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/ZWSFAA. Lu et al., 2020). This cropland map has been used as an essential input to the Spatial Production Allocation Model (SPAM) for producing the global dataset of agricultural production circa 2010, which is described in the second part of the two-paper series.},

Under the ESA, it is illegal to kill an endangered species and it is also illegal to damage its habitat. By preventing the establishment of an old-growth pine stand, landowners can ensure that RCWs do not inhabit their land and avoid ESA regulations that limit or prohibit timber harvest activity. Data from 1984\textendash 90 on over 1,000 individual forest plots are used to test predictions about the probability of harvest and the age of timber when it is harvested. We find that increases in the proximity of a plot to RCWs increases the probability that the plot will be harvested and decreases the age at which the forest is harvested.},

In this study, future climate change in the TP was projected for 2041-2060 by a high-resolution regional climate model, RegCM4, under 3 representative concentration pathways (RCPs): 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5. Response of all key hydrological 01_manuscript, that is, evapotranspiration, surface run-off, baseflow, and snowmelt, to future climate in 2 typical catchments, the source regions of Yellow and Yangtze rivers, was further investigated by the variable infiltration capacity microscale hydrological model incorporated with a 2-layer energy balance snow model and a frozen soil/permafrost algorithm at a 0.25 degrees x0.25 degrees spatial scale. The results reveal that (a) spatial patterns of precipitation and temperature from RegCM4 agree fairly well with the data from China Meteorological Forcing Dataset, indicating that RegCM4 well reproduces historical climatic information and thus is reliable to support future projection; (b) precipitation increase by 0-70\% and temperature rise by 1-4 degrees C would occur in the TP under 3 RCPs. A clear south-eastern-north-western spatial increasing gradient in precipitation would be seen. Besides, under RCP8.5, the peak increase in temperature would approach to 4 degrees C in spring and autumn in the east of the TP; (c) evapotranspiration would increase by 10-60\% in 2 source regions due to the temperature rise, surface run-off and baseflow in higher elevation region would experience larger increase dominantly due to the precipitation increase, and streamflow would display general increases by more than 3\% and 5\% in the source regions of Yellow and Yangtze rivers, respectively; (d) snowmelt contributes 11.1\% and 16.2\% to total run-off in the source regions of Yellow and Yangtze rivers, respectively, during the baseline period. In the source region of Yangtze River, snowmelt run-off would become more important with increase of 17.5\% and 18.3\%, respectively, under RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 but decrease of 15.0\% under RCP8.5.},

However, landscape and its change are complex with high spatial heterogeneity, which challenges strategic decision-making. This paper aims to derive management meaningful units based on landscape status and change analysis and the generalization of landscape spatial heterogeneity. Based on contrasting cases from Finland (Vanajavesi) and China (Baota District), this paper analyzed the landscape attributes and change since 2000. A k-means clustering approach was used to generalize the landscape types based on indicators of landscape composition and its change, spatial pattern, population, and income. Most significant change in land covers was the expansion of artificial surfaces, and the bi-directional transitions between agricultural areas and forests and semi-natural areas in Vanajavesi, while the expansion of artificial land and shrinkage of cropland were most significant in Baota District. Larger changes in landscape metrics were also observed in Baota District. Finally, three landscape clusters were generalized in both of the case areas. For each cluster, the landscapes and their change characteristics were interpreted as pertinent to the average land cover pattern and its change and socioeconomic conditions. Brief landscape management recommendations were also given for the resulting clusters. This paper contributes to enriching the understanding of the analysis and management of landscape spatial heterogeneity based on the information from both landscape status and change. The contrasting case analyses from an international perspective indicate the usefulness of clustering approach in accommodating spatial heterogeneity, which imply a regionalized need for landscape monitoring, assessment, and management.},

When total rainfall slightly increased in the area, discharge dramatically decreased by 40\%-70\% after the year of 2000, and attracting extensive attention in the context of global climate change. High temporal resolution precipitation (timescales between 1 and 4 h) data from the June to September period from 270 rain gauges over the past three decades was mined in order to help explain the phenomenon. Each rainfall event was classified as light/moderate rain, large rain, heavy rain or rainstorm by the event's rainfall amount, and further classified as low intensity rain, medium intensity rain and high intensity rain by the event's rainfall intensity. The Mann-Kendall trend test was applied to detect the presence and significance of monotonic trends, and to find the change points in the mean and variance of the precipitation characteristics series, including the amount, intensity, frequency and duration of each rainfall category. Results show that although the total amount of precipitation has slightly increased, the average rainfall intensity has significantly decreased. The larger change happened in light/moderate rain events and low/medium intensity rain events, and the intensity changes have a great extent occurred around the threshold of Non-Runoff Rainfall regime, which was proposed for the approximate calculation of initial losses. Changes in rainfall distribution between different classes of the Runoff Rainfall regime in the 2000s could lead to 0.9 mm less runoff depth (17.3\% of the total reduction) than the 1980-1999 period. The study indicates that changes in hourly precipitation may be responsible for the sharp reduction of discharge.},

  abstract = {Permafrost is mostly warm and thermally unstable on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), particularly in some marginal areas, thereby being susceptible to degrade or even disappear under climate warming. The degradation of permafrost consequently leads to changes in hydrological cycles associated with seasonal freeze-thaw processes. In this study, we investigated seasonal hydrothermal processes of near-surface permafrost layers and their responses to rain events at two warm permafrost sites in the Headwater Area of the Yellow River, northeastern TP. Results demonstrated that water content in shallow active layers changed with infiltration of rainwater, whereas kept stable in the perennially frozen layer, which serves as an aquitard due to low hydraulic conductivity or even imperviousness. Accordingly, the supra-permafrost water acts as a seasonal aquifer in the thawing period and as a seasonal aquitard in the freezing period. Seasonal freeze-thaw processes in association with rain events correlate well with the recharge and discharge of the supra-permafrost water. Super-heavy precipitation (44 mm occurred on 2 July 2015) caused a sharp increase in soil water content and dramatic rises in soil temperatures by 0.3-0.5 degrees C at shallow depths and advancement thawing of the active layer by half a month. However, more summer precipitation amount tends to reduce the seasonal amplitude of soil temperatures, decrease mean annual soil temperatures and thawing indices and thin active layers. High salinity results in the long remaining of a large amount of unfrozen water around the bottom of the active layer. We conclude that extremely warm permafrost with T-ZAR (the temperature at the depth of zero annual amplitude) {$>$} 0.5 degrees C is likely percolated under heavy and super-heavy precipitation events, while hydrothermal processes around the permafrost table likely present three stages concerning TZAR of {$<$} 0.5 degrees C, 0.5-0 degrees C, and {$>$} 0 degrees C.},

Many CE practitioners consider the first international CE agreement between China and the EU a milestone towards such an effort. This analysis shows why this expectation is premature. European and Chinese stakeholders' optimistic and depoliticized CE narratives disable communication regarding development disparities, negative competition and distrust, which shape geopolitical rivalry. While skeptical narratives that address political barriers exist, they fall short of suggesting alternatives. Based on 72 stakeholder interviews, 40 documents and participant observation, these results highlight the critical importance of inves\- tigating narrative strategies to repoliticize environmental cooperation. Such narrative strategies would support contestation and negotiation on development disparities and open channels for joint conceptualization of implementation scales for environmental strategies, circular or otherwise. We therefore propose using constructivist perspectives of international relations to explore discursive barriers and enablers to global envi\- ronmental action.},

According to a frequently cited definition of economics by Robbins [41, p. 16]: ``Economics is the science which studies human behavior as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses.'' In the Concise Encyclopedia of Economics,1 this definition of economics is still used to define the subject today. Although this definition is simplified and ``it cannot be understood as a complete list of topics belonging to economics, the scarcity principle certainly plays some role in all economic studies'' [40, p. 13; translated by the author]. Scarce commodities are those which are both desired and not freely available. The scarcity of resources cannot be eliminated; rather, choices must be made about how resources will be used.},

  abstract = {Sustainable development (SD) as popularized by the Brundtland Commission and politically enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals has been the explicit focus of sustainability science. While there is broad agreement that the trend of human well-being (W) over time should serve as a sustainability criterion, the literature so far has mostly addressed this in terms of its determinants rather than focusing on W itself. There is broad agreement that an indicator for W should have multiple constituents, clearly going beyond gross domestic product. Here, we propose a tailor-made indicator to serve precisely this purpose following a set of specified desiderata, including its applicability to flexibly defined subnational populations by gender, place of residence, ethnicity, and other relevant characteristics. The indicator, years of good life (YoGL), reflects the evident fact that in order to be able to enjoy any quality of life, one has to be alive and thus is primarily based on life expectancy. However, since mere survival is not considered good enough, life years are counted conditional on meeting minimum standards in two dimensions: the objective dimension of capable longevity (consisting of being out of absolute poverty and enjoying minimal levels of physical and cognitive health) and the subjective dimension of overall life satisfaction. We illustrate the calculation of this indicator for countries and subpopulations at different stages of development and with different degrees of data availability.},

In this study, the effects of precipitation amount (P), precipitation intensity (i), potential evapotranspiration (ET0), and multiple catchment characteristics parameters (including parameter n of the Choudhury-Yang equation and vegetation leaf area index, LAI) on naturalized streamflow were estimated for the Yellow River Basin of China using elasticity of streamflow. The results showed that the naturalized streamflow was most sensitive to ET0, followed by P and i in terms of climate elasticity. The factors responsible for the decrease in naturalized streamflow in 2001\textendash 2010 relative to 1961\textendash 2000 varied across the basin. Factors i and ET0 played the most important roles in the headwaters and were responsible for 27.0\% and \`A82.7\% of the absolute streamflow change. The dominant factors were P (\`A17.6\% to \`A12.5\%), ET0 (\`A19.2\% to \`A14.4\%), and LAI (\`A22.9\% to \`A14.0\%) in the middle-lower subbasins. The contributions of parameter n and LAI were similar in the headwaters, but the contribution of LAI became relatively large in the downstream. The physical meaning of n, which has not been clearly identified, was discussed in this study. The annual n was correlated well with the sum of evapotranspiration and terrestrial water storage, which represents the water both stored in the ground and evaporated into the air. The findings of this study can provide guidance for the river basin water resource management.},

  abstract = {Changes in water and sediment conditions in the Upper Yellow River Basin (UYRB), which contains the ecological barrier and "water tower" of the entire Yellow River Basin, directly affect the development of the downstream ecological environment. In this study, the impacts of recent and potential land use and climate changes on runoff and sediment load were investigated through statistical analysis, land-use maps, scenario estimations, and hydrological modelling. The temporal trends and abrupt changes in hydro-meteorological 01_manuscript from 1957-2010 were analysed using linear regressions and moving-t tests. Transformations in land use from 1990 to 2014 were determined using a transfer matrix analysis. The back propagation neural network was constructed to modify and integrate several general climate models, and it projected the climate change evolution characteristics in the UYRB from 2021 to 2100 under different emission scenarios. On this basis, the effects of recent and potential land use and climate changes on runoff and sediment load were quantified using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model and fifteen climate scenarios, respectively. The results show a significant decreasing trends for both runoff and sediment loads with warmer and wetter climate conditions in the past 50 years. An abrupt change in runoff occurred in 1990, and a notable change in sediment load occurred in 2000 which was defined as the dividing year of the study period. The warm and wet climate characteristics of the UYRB will continue from 2021 to 2100. Over the past 20 years, the transformation of land use in the URYB has intensified. Therefore, land use changes between 1990 and 2000 show significant increasing wetland trends and decreasing bare land and grassland trends. The SWAT simulation results indicated that climate changes have had a more significant impact on runoff than land use changes in the past 20 years, increasing runoff by 6.32\%. Both land use and climate changes have great impacts on sediment load reduction. For the next 80 years, the potential land use change demonstrated greater impacts on runoff and sediment load than climate changes. The runoff and sediment load exhibited different trends under various climate conditions and emission scenarios. The results obtained in this study can provide useful information for water resource management, soil and water conservation, and ecological protection in the UYRB.},

In this study, Chabagou River Basin in the central arid region of the Loess Plateau was selected to investigate changes in runoff, within which a series of soil conservation measures have been implemented since the late 1950s. We applied the non-parametric Kendall test (MK) and the Bayesian change point (BCP) method to identify trends and potential change points in hydro-meteorological data sequences. The results of the MK test revealed no significantly abrupt variation has been detected in annual hydro-meteorological data sequences, while a number of potential change points were identified using the BCP method applying different posterior probabilities. We also systematically review two commonly applied quantitative methods that draw on both empirical statistics and hydrological modeling to quantify the impact of climate change, human activities and meteorological variation on mean annual runoff at spatiotemporal scales based on precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff-precipitation coefficients, and soil water throughout the river basin. The results of this study show that climate change and normal climate variability are responsible for about 80\% of the decrease in runoff, mainly due to reduced precipitation, while human activities was responsible for {$<$} 20\% of reductions in runoff. The results also show that soil conservation measures have influenced hydrological processes at spatiotemporal and that runoff within the Chabagou River Basin (CRB) is more sensitive to spatial distribution of soil conservation measures than meteorological factors. The relative contributions to runoff variations that derive from climate change, human activities and meteorological variation were calculated in this study, but interactions between climate change and human activities is complex, and not easy to be separated.},

  abstract = {The complexity of climate system dynamics calls for more elaborate drought evaluation and trend projection under different future climate scenarios. In this study, the meteorological drought stress over the Yellow River basin (YRB) of China for the next forty years (2021-2060) is comprehensively evaluated based on meteorological simulations of eight climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) with three representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) is used as a metric of drought magnitude at multiple temporal scales, while the multi-threshold run analysis is conducted for the definition of drought events and derivation of drought characteristics (e.g., frequency, duration and severity). The Mann-Kendall test is adopted as a universal tool to analyse the trends in climate variables (precipitation and temperature), multi-temporal SPEI drought indices and drought characteristics (duration and severity). Our preliminary conclusions include that partially increasing precipitation and generally rising temperature are likely to be seen in the YRB from 2021 to 2060. More importantly, a warmer YRB may undergo either a nearly regular atmospheric regime (e.g., comparable to the baseline period of 1961-2000) with RCP2.6 scenario or significantly drying processes with RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Meanwhile, the enhanced spatiotemporal variability/heterogeneity of meteorological forcing (e.g., precipitation and temperature) and drought characteristics (e.g., magnitude, frequency, duration and severity) would also increase future uncertainty of meteorological drought stress over the YRB, such as the encounter of drought with long duration and/or high severity and relevant increasing trends. Understanding the spatiotemporal influences of specific climate and emission scenarios on projected drought vulnerability might help improving our knowledge of climate-human interactions and selecting rational development strategy (like the low emission scenario of RCP2.6 or so) for regional adaptation to future climate change.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River is the second largest river in China and is well-known for its high sediment load. Since 2002, water-sediment regulation has been performed annually to scour the silted river channel in the lower reaches and to promote release of sediment from the large reservoirs. Here we present a comprehensive study of the variations in distribution and emission of dissolved N2O in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and its estuary based on: (i) monthly sampling at a lower-river station (Kenli) from November 2008 to December 2009, (ii) daily monitoring at this station during the water-sediment regulation event in summer of 2009, and (iii) field surveys of the estuary before, during, and after the regulation event. N2O concentrations in the lower reaches of the Yellow River ranged from 8.78 to 24.26 nmol/L, and had high values in winter and spring. N2O flux from the Yellow River to the Bohai Sea was about 2.27 x 10(5) mol/year. Water-sediment regulation had a strong impact on N2O distribution and transportation in the lower Yellow River. A sharp increase of N2O (8-fold) occurred at the beginning of water-sediment regulation, and this excessive N2O was likely from stimulation of nitrification in the water column. A total of 55.9\% of the annual N2O input from the Yellow River to the Bohai Sea occurred during water-sediment regulation, but the corresponding water discharge during this period accounted for only 26.9\% of total runoff, N2O concentrations in the lower reaches of the Yellow River and its estuary were almost all super-saturated, and this region acted as a net source of atmospheric N2O. High N2O saturations and air-sea fluxes were present in the Yellow River estuary during water-sediment regulation. These results indicate that water-sediment regulation in the Yellow River has a great impact on the estuarine distribution and atmospheric emission of N2O, and that this effect lasts for several weeks.

To accurately quantify tree water use and to explain the related hydrological processes, it is important to collect reliable data for application in the estimation of sap flow and its response to environmental factors. This study measured sap flow in black locust in the 2015 and 2016 growth seasons using the thermal dissipation probes technique and laboratory-calibrated Granier's equation. The study showed that the laboratory calibrated coefficient a was much larger than the original value presented by Granier, while the coefficient beta was similar to the original one. The average daily transpiration was 2.1 mm day(-1) for 2015 and 1.6 mm day(-1) for 2016. Net solar radiation (Rn) was the key meteorological factor controlling sap flow, followed by vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and then temperature (T). VPD had a threshold control on sap flow at threshold values of 1.9 kPa for 2015 and 1.6 kPa for 2016. The effects of diurnal hysteresis of Rn, VPD and T on sap flow were evident, indicating that black locust water use was conservative.},

We analyze sediment transport data for the best-documented, fine-grained river worldwide, the Huanghe (Yellow River) of China, where sediment flux is underpredicted by an order of magnitude according to well-accepted sediment transport relations. Our theoretical framework, bolstered by field observations, demonstrates that the Huanghe tends toward upper-stage plane bed, yielding minimal form drag, thus markedly enhancing sediment transport efficiency. We present a sediment transport formulation applicable to all river systems with silt to coarse-sand beds. This formulation demonstrates a remarkably sensitive dependence on grain size within a certain narrow range and therefore has special relevance to silt-sand fluvial systems, particularly those affected by dams. We analyze why the sediment discharges of fine-grained rivers are an order of magnitude larger than predicted by current theory.

However, despite a long history of US-led interdiction efforts in the Western Hemisphere, cocaine movements to the United States through Central America, or ``narco-trafficking,'' continue to rise. Here, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM), called ``NarcoLogic,'' of narco-trafficker operational decision making in response to interdiction forces to investigate the root causes of interdiction ineffectiveness across space and time. The central premise tested was that spatial proliferation and resiliency of narco-trafficking are not a consequence of ineffective interdiction, but rather part and natural consequence of interdiction itself. Model development relied on multiple theoretical perspectives, empirical studies, media reports, and the authors' own years of field research in the region. Parameterization and validation used the best available, authoritative data source for illicit cocaine flows. Despite inherently biased, unreliable, and/or incomplete data of a clandestine phenomenon, the model compellingly reproduced the ``cat-and-mouse'' dynamic between narco-traffickers and interdiction forces others have qualitatively described. The model produced qualitatively accurate and quantitatively realistic spatial and temporal patterns of cocaine trafficking in response to interdiction events. The NarcoLogic model offers a much-needed, evidence-based tool for the robust assessment of different drug policy scenarios, and their likely impact on trafficker behavior and the many collateral damages associated with the militarized war on drugs.},

Some scholars argue that changes in behaviour at the scale necessary to address this crisis will require wholesale change in cultural values. However, evidence is lacking on whether values are shifting. To better understand this phenomenon, we analysed long-term, large-scale trend data regarding wildlife values in the United States, collected through a 19-state survey in 2004 (n\,=\,12,673) and 2017\textendash 2018 (n\,=\,20,674). Findings confirmed an increased endorsement of mutualism values (seeing wildlife as part of one's social community and deserving of rights like humans) accompanied by a decline in values emphasizing domination (treating wildlife as resources to be used for human benefit), a trend further visible in cross-generational cohort analysis. We also found strong associations between state-level values and trends in urbanization, connecting the shift to macro-level socioeconomic factors. Results suggest positive outcomes for conservation but the field's ability to adapt will be critical to realizing those outcomes.},

This work demonstrates how sustainability science benefits from combining integrated agent-based modeling (which blends methods from the social, ecological, and information sciences) and mixed-methods research (which interleaves multiple approaches ranging from qualitative field research to quantitative laboratory experiments and interpretation of remotely sensed imagery). We test assumptions of utility-maximizing behavior in household-level landscape management in south-central Indiana, linking parcel data, land cover derived from aerial photography, and findings from laboratory experiments. We examine the role of uncertainty and limited information, preferences, differential demographic attributes, and past experience and future time horizons. We also use evolutionary programming to represent bounded rationality in agriculturalist households in the southern Yucat\'an of Mexico. This approach captures realistic rule of thumb strategies while identifying social and environmental factors in a manner similar to econometric models. These case studies highlight the role of computational models of decision making in land-change contexts and advance our understanding of decision making in general.},

Yet, as the public experiences extreme weather and other climate change-related impacts, their per\- ceptions of the issue may shift. Here, we explore whether, when, and where local climate trends have already influenced perceived experiences of global warming in the United States. Using a large national survey dataset (n = 13,607), we compare Americans' experiences of climate with corresponding trends in seven different highresolution climate indicators for the period 2008 to 2015. We find that increases in hot dry day exposure significantly increases individuals' perceptions that they have personally experienced global warming. We do not find robust evidence that other precipitation and temperature anomalies have had a similar effect. We also use multilevel modeling to explore county-level patterns of perceived experiences with climate change. Whereas the individual-level analysis describes a likely causal relationship between a changing climate and individuals' perceived experience, the multilevel model depicts county-level changes in perceived experience resulting from particular climate trends. Overall, we find that exposure to hot dry days, has a modest influence on perceived experience, independent of the political and socio-demographic factors that dominate U.S. climate opinions today.},

  abstract = {Modeling social-ecological interactions between humans and ecosystems to analyze their implications for sustainable management of social ecological systems (SES) has multiple challenges. When integrating social and ecological dynamics, which are often studied separately, one has to deal with different modeling paradigms, levels of analysis, temporal and spatial scales, and data availabilities in the social and ecological domains. A major challenge, for instance, is linking the emergent patterns from individual micro-level human decisions to system level processes such as reinforcing feedbacks determining the state of the ecosystem. We propose building a hybrid model that combines a system dynamics with an agent based approach to address some of these challenges. In particular, we present a procedure for model development and analysis that successively builds up complexity and understanding of model dynamics, particular with respect to feedbacks between the social and ecological system components. The proposed steps allow for a systematic increase of the coupling between the submodels and building confidence in the model before deploying it to study the coupled dynamics. The procedure consists of steps for (i) specifying the characteristics of the link between the social and ecological systems, (ii) validating the decoupled submodels, (iii) doing sensitivity analysis of the decoupled submodels with respect to the drivers from the respective other subsystem and, finally (iv) analyzing the coupled model. We illustrate the procedure and discuss opportunities and limitations of hybrid models against the background of an archetypical SES case study, namely the restoration of a turbid lake. Our approach exemplifies how a hybrid model is used to unpack SES complexity and analyze interactions between ecological dynamics and micro-level human actions. We discuss the benefits and challenges of combining a system dynamics models as an aggregated view with an agent based model as a disaggregated view to improve social-ecological system understanding.},

  abstract = {Socio-hydrology advanced the field of hydrology by considering humans and their activities as part of the water cycle, rather than as external drivers. Models are used to infer reproducible trends in human interactions with water resources. However, defining and handling water problems in this way may restrict the scope of such modeling approaches. We propose an interdisciplinary socio-hydrological approach to overcome this limit and complement modeling approaches. It starts from concrete field-based situations, combines disciplinary as well as local knowledge on water-society relationships, with the aim of broadening the hydrocentric analysis and modeling of water systems. The paper argues that an analysis of social dynamics linked to water is highly complementary to traditional hydrological tools but requires a negotiated and contextualized interdisciplinary approach to the representation and analysis of socio-hydro systems. This reflection emerged from experience gained in the field where a water-budget modeling framework failed to adequately incorporate the multiplicity of (nonhydrological) factors that determine the volumes of withdrawals for irrigation. The pathway subsequently explored was to move away from the hydrologic view of the phenomena and, in collaboration with social scientists, to produce a shared conceptualization of a coupled human-water system through a negotiated approach. This approach changed the way hydrological research issues were addressed and limited the number of strong assumptions needed for simplification in modeling. The proposed socio-hydrological approach led to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind local water-related problems and to debates on the interactions between social and political decisions and the dynamics of these problems.},

  abstract = {Fine-grained sediment (grain size under 2,000 {$\mu$}m) builds floodplains and deltas, and shapes the coastlines where much of humanity lives. However, a universal, physically based predictor of sediment flux for fine-grained rivers remains to be developed. Herein, a comprehensive sediment load database for fine-grained channels, ranging from small experimental flumes to megarivers, is used to find a predictive algorithm. Two distinct transport regimes emerge, separated by a discontinuous transition for median bed grain size within the very fine sand range (81 to 154 {$\mu$}m), whereby sediment flux decreases by up to 100-fold for coarser sand-bedded rivers compared to river with silt and very fine sand beds. Evidence suggests that the discontinuous change in sediment load originates from a transition of transport mode between mixed suspended bed load transport and suspension-dominated transport. Events that alter bed sediment size near the transition may significantly affect fluviocoastal morphology by drastically changing sediment flux, as shown by data from the Yellow River, China, which, over time, transitioned back and forth 3 times between states of high and low transport efficiency in response to anthropic activities.},

Being a major component of the global water cycle, evapotranspiration (ET) serves as an indicator of the availability of water resources. Understanding the actual ET (ETa) variation mechanism at different spatial and temporal scales can improve management of water use within the sustainable development limits. In this study, remote sensing derived ETa data were used to study water resource fluctuations in the Loess Plateau, China. This region covers diverse climate types from humid to arid and experienced large changes in vegetation cover during a revegetation project between 2000 and 2015. The relations between spatiotemporal variation of ETa, climate factors and vegetation change were explored using statistical methods. The results show that cropland, forestland and grassland lake the largest percentage of total ETa. Total ETa exhibited a marginally increasing trend (p {$<$}0.1) during 2000-2010 and no trend during 2011-2015. Windspeed and vegetation cover index highly influenced ETa, followed by atmospheric pressure, air humidity, precipitation, bright sunshine duration and temperature. Temperature has little effect on ETa throughout the Loess Plateau. The monitoring of water resources based upon water balance between precipitation, ETa and river flow changes shows that water consumption deficit is consistent with vegetation changes: it was large during 2000-2010 when vegetation increased rapidly and decreased after 2010. These results could help to develop different water saving strategies across the Loess Plateau and build a better monitoring system of water resources.},

Stringent mitigation will have clear societal benefits in the second half of this century by limiting peak warming and stabilizing climate. However, the near-term benefits of mitigation are generally thought to be less clear because forced surface temperature trends can be masked by internal variability. Here we use observationally constrained projections from the latest comprehensive climate models and a simple climate model emulator to show that pursuing stringent mitigation consistent with holding long-term warming below 1.5\,\textdegree C reduces the risk of unprecedented warming rates in the next 20 years by a factor of 13 compared with a no mitigation scenario, even after accounting for internal variability. Therefore, in addition to long-term benefits, stringent mitigation offers substantial near-term benefits by offering societies and ecosystems a greater chance to adapt to and avoid the worst climate change impacts.},

In standard growth models, technology is treated in the aggregate, but an economy can also be viewed as a network in which producers buy goods, convert them to new goods, and sell the production to households or other producers. We develop predictions for how this network amplifies the effects of technological improvements as they propagate along chains of production, showing that longer production chains for an industry bias it toward faster price reduction and that longer production chains for a country bias it toward faster growth. These predictions are in good agreement with data from the World Input Output Database and improve with the passage of time. The results show that production chains play a major role in shaping the long-term evolution of prices, output growth, and structural change.},

Our findings highlight that habitat area determines the variability of populations via changes in the distribution of species interaction strengths.

  abstract = {Silt loading is a critical problem in the use of the Yellow River for irrigation, domestic, and industrial water supplies. Nearly all of the silt comes in runoff from the immense and highly erodible Loess Plateau. Salinity has a secondary but widespread effect on irrigation development and groundwater quality. Engineering structures and expanded irrigation have reduced the silt load in the lower reach of the river by half over the last 50 years. Still, the level of the river bed continues to rise higher above the surrounding North China Plain. Millions of rural and urban lives are threatened by the possibility that an embankment will break and unleash a horrendous flood, as had happened numerous times prier to 1949. Earthquakes could cause similar castrophes. Increased populations in cities, expansion of irrigated land, and rapid industrialization have brought about locally severe water shortages. This, in turn, has led to surface and groundwater pollution by salt and heavy metals, lowering of groundwater levels, land subsidence, and salt water intrusion from the Bo Sea. Interbasin water transfers from the Yangtze River in the south to relieve water shortages in the north have been proposed for decades but remain controversial. The high cost of dams, canals, tunnels, pumping, and water control systems needed for the transfer has been a major objection. Other factors have been the adverse environmental impact in both the Yellow and Yangtze river watersheds of transfers and, importantly, the questionable need of the transfers if water conservation practices were used widely and effectively.},

We find that 52\% of the blue water footprint of global consumption and 43\% of international blue virtual water flows come from places where the sustainable environmental flow is violated. About 22\% of the environmental flow infringement of the blue water footprint of global consumption lies outside the specific countries of consumption, indicating that a number of them have externalized their impacts. By establishing a link between the consumption of a product in one place and water scarcity in places far from the place of consumption, our assessment may aid a dialogue on how to assign and share responsibilities concerning water use.},

The model takes into account the daily soil water balance and climatic conditions for each grid cell. In addition, the water pollution associated with the use of nitrogen fertilizer in crop production is estimated for each grid cell. The crop evapotranspiration of additional 20 minor crops is calculated with the CROPWAT model. In addition, we have calculated the water footprint of more than two hundred derived crop products, including various flours, beverages, fibres and biofuels.

An early and reliable ENSO forecasting remains a crucial goal, due to its serious implications for economy, society, and ecosystem. Despite the development of various dynamical and statistical prediction models in the recent decades, the ``spring predictability barrier'' (SPB) remains a great challenge for long (over 6-month) lead-time forecasting. To overcome this barrier, here we develop an analysis tool, the System Sample Entropy (SysSampEn), to measure the complexity (disorder) of the system composed of temperature anomaly time series in the Nin\texttildelow{} o 3.4 region. When applying this tool to several near surface air-temperature and sea surface temperature datasets, we find that in all datasets a strong positive correlation exists between the magnitude of El Nin\texttildelow{} o and the previous calendar year's SysSampEn (complexity). We show that this correlation allows to forecast the magnitude of an El Nin\texttildelow{} o with a prediction horizon of 1 year and high accuracy (i.e., Root Mean Square Error = 0.23{$\smwhtcircle$}C for the average of the individual datasets forecasts). For the on-going 2018 El Nin\texttildelow{} o event, our method forecasts a weak El Nin\texttildelow{} o with a magnitude of 1.11 {$\pm$} 0.23{$\smwhtcircle$}C. Our framework presented here not only facilitates a long\textendash term forecasting of the El Nin\texttildelow{} o magnitude but can potentially also be used as a measure for the complexity of other natural or engineering complex systems.},

We combine data from comprehensive United States lobbying records with an empirical method for forecasting the policy's effect on the value of publicly listed firms. Our statistical analysis suggests that lobbying by firms expecting losses from the policy was more effective than lobbying by firms expecting gains. Interpreting this finding through a game-theoretic model, we calculate that lobbying lowered the probability of enacting the Waxman\textendash Markey bill by 13 percentage points, representing an expected social cost of US\$60 billion (in 2018 US dollars). Our findings also suggest how future climate policy proposals can be designed to be more robust to political opposition.},

  abstract = {Changes in land systems generate many sustainability challenges. Identifying more sustainable land-use alternatives requires solid theoretical foundations on the causes of land-use/cover changes. Land system science is a maturing field that has produced a wealth of methodological innovations and empirical observations on land-cover and land-use change, from patterns and processes to causes. We take stock of this knowledge by reviewing and synthesizing the theories that explain the causal mechanisms of land-use change, including systemic linkages between distant land-use changes, with a focus on agriculture and forestry processes. We first review theories explaining changes in land-use extent, such as agricultural expansion, deforestation, frontier development, and land abandonment, and changes in land-use intensity, such as agricultural intensification and disintensification. We then synthesize theories of higher-level land system change processes, focusing on: (i) land-use spillovers, including land sparing and rebound effects with intensification, leakage, indirect land-use change, and land-use displacement, and (ii) land-use transitions, defined as structural non-linear changes in land systems, including forest transitions. Theories focusing on the causes of land system changes span theoretically and epistemologically disparate knowledge domains and build from deductive, abductive, and inductive approaches. A grand, integrated theory of land system change remains elusive. Yet, we show that middle-range theories \textendash{} defined here as contextual generalizations that describe chains of causal mechanisms explaining a well-bounded range of phenomena, as well as the conditions that trigger, enable, or prevent these causal chains \textendash, provide a path towards generalized knowledge of land systems. This knowledge can support progress towards sustainable social-ecological systems.},

  abstract = {Lack of hydrological data of high spatiotemporal resolution has been a major challenge for understanding the rainfall-runoff relationship on the Loess Plateau of China. In this study, we examined this relationship across 82 watersheds on the plateau for two time periods: P1 (1971-1987) and P2 (2008-2016). We found linear relationships between the annual rainfall series and annual surface runoff series in P1 that were stronger in the southeast and that declined toward the northwest, but this spatial pattern was slightly disrupted during P2. The mean annual runoff coefficient ranged from 0.056 to 0.126 for the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, during the P1 period, but the corresponding values were smaller in P2 (0.035 and 0.088, respectively). In total, the runoff coefficient decreased for 87\% of the watersheds, with an average reduction of 0.033. For most watersheds of the plateau, we found a stable threshold value for the monthly runoff coefficient when monthly rainfall reached a certain value (i.e., a critical point). Between P1 and P2, the threshold value of the runoff coefficient decreased for 57 watersheds as a result of soil conservation measures. The rainfall critical point represents the minimum monthly rainfall to maintain the stable relationship between monthly infiltration and monthly rainfall in the process of runoff production. This value became greater on the middle regions of the plateau during P2 (increasing by 28\% on average). Check dams, vegetation, and land use all have profoundly influenced the relationship between rainfall and surface runoff in this region.},

As a result, describing and understanding recent variations of water discharge and sediment load under global change scenarios are of considerable importance. The present study considers the annual hydrologic series of the water discharge and sediment load of the Yellow River basin obtained from 15 gauging stations (10 mainstream, 5 tributaries). The Mann-Kendall test method was adopted to detect both gradual and abrupt change of hydrological series since the 1950s. With the exception of the area draining to the Upper Tangnaihai station, results indicate that both water discharge and sediment load have decreased significantly (p{$<$}0.05). The declining trend is greater with distance downstream, and drainage area has a significant positive effect on the rate of decline. It is suggested that the abrupt change of the water discharge from the late 1980s to the early 1990s arose from human extraction, and that the abrupt change in sediment load was linked to disturbance from reservoir construction.},

  abstract = {The water shortage in the Yellow River, China, has been aggravated by rapid population growth and global climate changes. To identify the characteristics of streamflow change in the Yellow River, approximately 50 years of natural and observed streamflow data from 23 hydrological stations were examined. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to detect trends and abrupt change points. The results show that both the natural and the observed streamflow in the Yellow River basin present downward trends from 1956 to 2008, and the decreasing rate of observed streamflow is generally faster than that of the natural streamflow. Larger drainage areas have higher declining rates, and the declining trends are intensified downstream within the mainstream. The possibility of abrupt changes in observed streamflow is higher than in natural streamflow, and streamflow series in the mainstream are more likely to change abruptly than those in the tributaries. In the mainstream, all the significant abrupt changes appear in the middle and latter half of the 1980s, but the abrupt changes occur somewhat earlier for observed streamflow than for natural streamflow. The significant abrupt change for the observed streamflow in the tributaries is almost isochronous with the natural streamflow and occurs from the 1970s to 1990s. It is implied that the slight reduction in precipitation is not the only direct reason for the streamflow variation. Other than the effects of climate change, land-use and land-cover changes are the 01_manuscript reasons for the natural streamflow change. Therefore, the increasing net water diversion by humans is responsible for the observed streamflow change. It is estimated that the influence of human activity on the declining streamflow is enhanced over time.},

However, the preexisting research was mainly focused on the last half century. In this paper, the natural streamflow observed since 1470 at the Sanmenxia station in the middle Yellow River basin was collected, and the methods of variation coefficient, moving average, Mann-Kendall test and wavelet transform were applied to analyze the dynamic characteristics of the streamflow. The results showed that, (1) between 1470 and 2007, the natural streamflow changed 200-919 x 10(8) m(3), and water discharge varied moderately; (2) in the middle Yellow River basin, it appears that the most severe and most persistent droughts during circa 1868-1990, the periods of 1470s-1490s, 1920s-1930s and 1990s-2000s also presented the condition of sustained low flows; (3) the natural streamflow series shows increasing and decreasing trends during the periods of 1470-1880 and 1881-2007, respectively, but both trends are not significant at {$>$} 95\% confidence; in addition, it is still found the streamflow series shows abrupt changes circa 1845, 1935 and 1960, respectively; (4) within a 250-year scale, there are circa 11, 26, 67 and 120-year periods for natural streamflow at the Sanmenxia station, and the periodicity of the 120-year one is the strongest. The dynamic characteristics of natural streamflow is the comprehensive result by many influencing factors, such as precipitation, temperature, El Nino-Southern Oscillation, sunspots, human activity, etc.},

The structure of the hydrographic network and the combination of the natural and anthropogenic geosystems of the delta are characterized. The major external riverine and marine, as well as local anthropogenic factors that have affected the development of the Huang He delta in the recent half century are identified. The regularities of the jump-like development of the Huang He delta in the XIX-early XXI centuries are considered. Special attention is paid to the development of the delta after the artificial redistribution of flow in its boundaries in 1996. Satellite images and methods of their interpretation improved by the authors were used. The trends in Huang He delta development are shown to have changed since the last quarter of the XX century under the effect of an abrupt decrease in river sediment load and the growing impact of marine factors. The active progradation of the delta into the sea slowed down significantly, accompanied by erosion and retreat in many segments of its coastline. Huang He delta was used to establish the conditions of changes in the development trends of other deltas under the effect of changes in the climate and economic activity.},

  abstract = {Will a group of people reach a collective target through individual contributions when everyone suffers individually if the target is missed? This ``collective-risk social dilemma'' exists in various social scenarios, the globally most challenging one being the prevention of dangerous climate change. Reaching the collective target requires individual sacrifice, with benefits to all but no guarantee that others will also contribute. It even seems tempting to contribute less and save money to induce others to contribute more, hence the dilemma and the risk of failure. Here, we introduce the collective-risk social dilemma and simulate it in a controlled experiment: Will a group of people reach a fixed target sum through successive monetary contributions, when they know they will lose all their remaining money with a certain probability if they fail to reach the target sum? We find that, under high risk of simulated dangerous climate change, half of the groups succeed in reaching the target sum, whereas the others only marginally fail. When the risk of loss is only as high as the necessary average investment or even lower, the groups generally fail to reach the target sum. We conclude that one possible strategy to relieve the collective-risk dilemma in high-risk situations is to convince people that failure to invest enough is very likely to cause grave financial loss to the individual. Our analysis describes the social window humankind has to prevent dangerous climate change.},

  abstract = {Forests are projected to undergo dramatic compositional and structural shifts prompted by global changes, such as climatic changes and intensifying natural disturbance regimes. Future uncertainty makes planning for forest management exceptionally difficult, demanding novel approaches to maintain or improve the ability of forest ecosystems to respond and rapidly re-organize after disturbance events. Adopting a landscape perspective in forest management is particularly important in fragmented forest landscapes where both diversity and connectivity play key roles in determining resilience to global change. In this context, network analysis and functional traits combined with ecological dynamic modeling can help evaluate changes in functional response diversity and connectivity within and among forest stands in fragmented landscapes. Here, we coupled ecological dynamic modeling with functional traits analysis and network theory to analyze forested landscapes as an interconnected network of forest patches. We simulated future forest landscape dynamics in a large landscape in southern Quebec, Canada, under a combination of climate, disturbance, and management scenarios. We depicted the landscape as a functional network, assessed changes in future resilience using indicators at multiple spatial scales, and evaluated if current management practices are suitable for maintaining resilience to simulated changes in regimes. Our results show that climate change would promote forest productivity and favor heat-adapted deciduous species. Changes in natural disturbances will likely have negative impacts on native conifers and will drive changes in forest type composition. Climate change negatively impacted all resilience indicators and triggered losses of functional response diversity and connectivity across the landscape with undesirable consequences on the capacity of these forests to adapt to global change. Also, current management strategies failed to promote resilience at different spatial levels, highlighting the need for a more active and thoughtful approach to forest management under global change. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of combining dynamic landscape scale simulation modeling with network analyses to evaluate the possible impacts of climate change as well as human and natural disturbances on forest resilience under global change.},

The purpose of Panta Rhei is to reach an improved interpretation of the processes governing the water cycle by focusing on their changing dynamics in connection with rapidly changing human systems. The practical aim is to improve our capability to make predictions of water resources dynamics to support sustainable societal development in a changing environment. The concept implies a focus on hydrological systems as a changing interface between environment and society, whose dynamics are essential to determine water security, human safety and development, and to set priorities for environmental management. The Scientific Decade 2013\textendash 2022 will devise innovative theoretical blueprints for the representation of processes including change and will focus on advanced monitoring and data analysis techniques. Interdisciplinarity will be sought by increased efforts to connect with the socio-economic sciences and geosciences in general.

Comparatively, however, it remains unclear how ecosystems recover after disturbances. In this perspective, I contend that ecological restoration should advance toward a general, dynamic theory that describes the recovery rates and trajectories of ecosystems along restoration. This approach should address three fundamental challenges corresponding to three components of ecological systems: complexity (how do we quantify ecological restoration?), space (what are the spatial scales of restoration?), and global change (how does global change determine restoration's reference states?). A generic model and experiment based on metacommunities is used to illustrate how these challenges can be addressed. Given the extent of ecosystem degradation and the international consensus to restore ecosystems, revealing the patterns and mechanisms underlying recovery is a fundamental and timely issue toward a general theory of ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {River deltas grow by repeating cycles of lobe development punctuated by channel avulsions, so that over time, lobes amalgamate to produce a composite landform. Existing models have shown that backwater hydrodynamics are important in avulsion dynamics, but the effect of lobe progradation on avulsion frequency and location has yet to be explored. Herein, a quasi-2-D numerical model incorporating channel avulsion and lobe development cycles is developed. The model is validated by the well-constrained case of a prograding lobe on the Yellow River delta, China. It is determined that with lobe progradation, avulsion frequency decreases, and avulsion length increases, relative to conditions where a delta lobe does not prograde. Lobe progradation lowers the channel bed gradient, which results in channel aggradation over the delta topset that is focused farther upstream, shifting the avulsion location upstream. Furthermore, the frequency and location of channel avulsions are sensitive to the threshold in channel bed superelevation that triggers an avulsion. For example, avulsions occur less frequently with a larger superelevation threshold, resulting in greater lobe progradation and avulsions that occur farther upstream. When the delta lobe length prior to avulsion is a moderate fraction of the backwater length (0.3-0.5L?b), the interplay between variable water discharge and lobe progradation together set the avulsion location, and a model capturing both processes is necessary to predict avulsion timing and location. While this study is validated by data from the Yellow River delta, the numerical framework is rooted in physical relationships and can therefore be extended to other deltaic systems.},

  abstract = {Currently the most popular approach in socio hydrology is to develop coupled human\textendash water models. This article proposes an alternative approach, qualitative case study research, involving a systematic review of (1) the human activities affecting the hydrology in the case, (2) the 01_manuscript human actors, and (3) the 01_manuscript factors influencing the actors and their activities. Moreover, this article presents a case study of the Dommel Basin in Belgium and the Netherlands, and compares this with a coupled model of the Kissimmee Basin in Florida. In both basins a ``pendulum swing'' from water resources development and control to protection and restoration can be observed. The Dommel case study moreover points to the importance of institutional and financial arrangements, community values, and broader social, economic, and technical developments. These factors are missing from the Kissimmee model. Generally, case studies can result in a more complete understanding of individual cases than coupled models, and if the cases are selected carefully and compared with previous studies, it is possible to generalize on the basis of them. Case studies also offer more levers for management and facilitate interdisciplinary cooperation. Coupled models, on the other hand, can be used to generate possible explanations of past developments and quantitative scenarios for future developments. The article concludes that, given the limited attention they currently get and their potential benefits, case studies deserve more attention in sociohydrology.},

Consumption, inequality, and population have increased extremely fast, especially since about 1950, threatening to overwhelm the many critical functions and ecosystems of the Earth System. Changes in the Earth System, in turn, have important feedback effects on the Human System, with costly and potentially serious consequences. However, current models do not incorporate these critical feedbacks. We argue that in order to understand the dynamics of either system, Earth System Models must be coupled with Human System Models through bidirectional couplings representing the positive, negative, and delayed feedbacks that exist in the real systems. In particular, key Human System variables, such as demographics, inequality, economic growth, and migration, are not coupled with the Earth System but are instead driven by exogenous estimates, such as United Nations population projections. This makes current models likely to miss important feedbacks in the real Earth-Human system, especially those that may result in unexpected or counterintuitive outcomes, and thus requiring different policy interventions from current models. The importance and imminence of sustainability challenges, the dominant role of the Human System in the Earth System, and the essential roles the Earth System plays for the Human System, all call for collaboration of natural scientists, social scientists, and engineers in multidisciplinary research and modeling to develop coupled Earth-Human system models for devising effective science-based policies and measures to benefit current and future generations.},

In this type of decision-making, agents need to reason and act strategically. Therefore, game theory can be used to study the strategic interactions among decision-makers. This paper presents a new hierarchical decision-making methodology, which uses the advantages of both game theory (i.e. Stackelberg leadership model) and Evidential Reasoning (ER). ER, as a multi-attribute decision-making method, considers both qualitative and quantitative attributes, and incorporates existing uncertainties in evaluating alternatives. The backward induction method and Monte-Carlo theory are used to solve the deterministic and stochastic forms of the proposed leader\textendash follower game. The methodology is applied to choose the best restoration scenario for Urmia Lake, which is the biggest saltwater lake in the Middle East. In the past decade, the lake's surface area has dramatically decreased due to climate change and an anthropogenic drought. In this paper, 19 lake restoration scenarios have been evaluated, and a scenario, which is corresponding to a 40\% reduction in agricultural water consumption and water release from Nezam Abad dam, is found to be the equilibrium solution for both types of the game.},

The concept of planetary boundaries evaluates whether the environmental loads from humans are within the carrying capacity of the environment at a global level, while the region-specific assessment of carrying capacities of freshwater consumption can complement the global-scale sustainability assessment by shedding light on regional sustainability. We show that 24\% of the total freshwater consumption exceeds the regional carrying capacities based on spatially and temporally explicit analysis (monthly data for around 11\,000 watersheds). Although 19\% of the current total freshwater consumption is determined as ``luxury consumption'' beyond basic needs, approximately 60\% of the exceedance is attributed to basic needs of freshwater for sustaining human life. International trade alleviates the overall pressure on carrying capacity by approximately 4.8\% (18.9 billion m3) at a global level through virtual water trade; however, several producer countries demonstrate additional overconsumption beyond the regional carrying capacities, while importer countries that can do so mitigate overconsumption. Appropriate irrigation water management and the location of crop production are the keys to maintain our freshwater consumption levels within the regional carrying capacities on a global scale. However, measures that necessitate the consideration of watershed-specific environmental and economic conditions are desirable.},

It often presumes the existence of public infrastructure that actualizes these incentives and regulations through a process loosely referred to as `governance.' In many cases, it is not clear if and how such governance infrastructure can be created and supported. Here, we take a complex systems view in which `governance' is an emergent phenomenon generated by interactions between social, economic, and environmental (both built and natural) factors. We present a framework and formal stylized model to explore under what circumstances stable governance structures may emerge endogenously in coupled infrastructure systems comprising shared natural, social, and built infrastructures of which social-ecological systems are specific examples. The model allows us to derive general conditions for a sustainable coupled infrastructure system in which critical infrastructure (e.g., canals) is provided by a governing entity that enables resource users (e.g., farmers) to produce outputs from natural infrastructure (e.g., water) to meet their needs while supporting the governing entity.},

TWI2050 is a global research initiative launched by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), and the Stockholm Resilience Centre (SRC). The initiative brings together a network of more than 150 participants that includes leading policymakers, analysts, modelling and analytical teams from 60 organizations from around the world to collaborate in developing pathways toward sustainable futures and the policy frameworks needed for implementing the SDGs, and more importantly, for achieving the needed transformational change. This report of the international TWI2050 scientific initiative was prepared by more than 60 authors and 20 organization and was launched at UN High-level Political Forum, 9-18 July 2018. It comprises key messages, synthesis and four chapters. Chapter 1 introduced TWI2050 framework. The narrative and target spaces are presented briefly in Chapter 1 and will be further refined in the next phase of TWI2050 and published. Chapter 2 examines, at the global scale, some major current trends in demography, economics, finance, society and politics. It presents potential major tipping points and dynamics that are likely to interact thereby creating a very different world from the present. It assesses currently observable megatrends and historical patterns with corresponding path dependencies. The chapter points to several of these megatrends that need to be taken into consideration how to achieve the transformation to sustainability. Chapter 3 investigates the characteristics of pathways that would lead to sustainable future. It first assess the scientific literature on pathways that achieve several SDGs. Next, implications of the linkages across SDGs are highlighted by presenting model-based pathways which follow an integrated approach with special emphasis on the six transformations. Pathways are presented that feature SDGs under review at HLPF 2018 (SDGs 6, 7, 11, 12 and 15). The chapter concludes with a discussion of research implications. Chapter 4 presents - from multiple perspectives - the governance framework required to achieve and steer transformations toward sustainability. This governance framework comprises of both fine tailored policy principles across the social, economic and political domains as well as enabling conditions for the great (societal) transformation that is needed to achieve the sustainability aspirations. The 01_manuscript findings and conclusions of the four chapters are summarized in the Synthesis presented at the beginning of the report that also connects them to policy interventions.},

The purpose of this study was to ``assessing farmers' drought risk management be\- havior (FDRMB) in downstream of Karkheh Dam basin, Iran''. For this purpose, the ``protection motivation theory (PMT)'' was used to measure FDRMB. This theory consists of six variables i.e. ``perceived vulnerability (PV)'', ``perceived severity (PS)'', ``self-efficacy (SE)'', ``response cost (RC)'', ``response efficacy (RC)'', and ``in\- tention (IN)''. This research included a descriptive-correlational and causal relationship that was conducted by a survey. The study population included farmers who were members in the water user association in downstream of Karkheh Dam (N = 3668), out of which, 350 users were sampled by Krejcie and Morgan's table and by the stratified random sampling method, respectively. In accordance with the PMT, for the variables affecting FDRMB a causal framework was designed. Findings from the path analysis indicated that the six variables in PMT might explain 0.473 of the FDRMB variance. Besides, SE had the highest effect in FDRMB ({$\beta$} = 0.503). As a general conclusion, policies need to make farmers take their own risk management decisions and have access to a variety of tools and strategies.},

The dominant research tradition on adaptation to environmental change primarily takes an actorcentered view, focusing on the agency of social actors to respond to specific environmental stimuli and emphasizing the reduction of vulnerabilities. The resilience approach is systems orientated, takes a more dynamic view, and sees adaptive capacity as a core feature of resilient social-ecological systems. The two approaches converge in identifying necessary components of adaptation. We argue that resilience provides a useful framework to analyze adaptation processes and to identify appropriate policy responses. We distinguish between incremental adjustments and transformative action and demonstrate that the sources of resilience for taking adaptive action are common across scales. These are the inherent system characteristics that absorb perturbations without losing function, networks and social capital that allow autonomous action, and resources that promote institutional learning.},

  abstract = {Despite considerable advancement in the study of network evolution, three basic limitations are common to the data collected: (1) examining a small number of networks, (2) not observing networks from scratch, (3) not collecting time-stamped, continuous records of all interactions among all members of groups. Here, we avoid these limitations by observing all aggressive interactions leading to network formation from the moment of introduction among all members of 45 groups of four individuals each in three species of animals: chickens, cichlid fish, and mice. We apply several recently developed methods for the visualization and analysis of network evolution to these unique datasets. We discover, first, that network evolution is a remarkably dynamic process across all three species: networks do not evolve to specific structures and then remain in those configurations. Instead, we find dynamic stability in which many groups continually return to a general class of structures. Second, we find considerable similarity across species in the pathways that the groups take through different possible network configurations as they evolve. Third, we show that transitive component triads are more stable than intransitive ones. Fourth, we track the evolution of individual ranks within groups and discover that many individuals do not have stable positions. Finally, we discuss fundamental questions that our findings raise for the study of networks in both animals and humans.},

Global models help us to understand the consequences of environmental changes for biodiversity, but tend to neglect important geographical variation in the sensitivity of biodiversity to these changes. Here we test whether biodiversity responses to climate change and land-use change differ among biomes (geographical units that have marked differences in environment and species composition). We find the strongest negative responses to both pressures in tropical biomes and in the Mediterranean. A further analysis points towards similar underlying drivers for the sensitivity to each pressure: we find both greater reductions in species richness in the types of land use most disturbed by humans and more negative predicted responses to climate change in areas of lower climatic seasonality, and in areas where a greater proportion of species are near their upper temperature limit. Within the land most modified by humans, reductions in biodiversity were particularly large in regions where humans have come to dominate the land more recently. Our results will help to improve predictions of how biodiversity is likely to change with ongoing climatic and land-use changes, pointing toward particularly large declines in the tropics where much future agricultural expansion is expected to occur. This finding could help to inform the development of the post-2020 biodiversity framework, by highlighting the under-studied regions where biodiversity losses are likely to be greatest.},

Here we show how the morphology of about 11,000 coastal deltas worldwide, ranging from small bayhead deltas to mega-deltas, has been affected by river damming and deforestation. We introduce a model that shows that present-day delta morphology varies across a continuum between wave (about 80 per cent), tide (around 10 per cent) and river (about 10 per cent) dominance, but that most large deltas are tide- and river-dominated. Over the past 30 years, despite sea-level rise, deltas globally have experienced a net land gain of 54~{$\pm~$}12 square kilometres per year (2 standard deviations), with the largest 1 per cent of deltas being responsible for 30 per cent of all net land area gains.

  abstract = {In view of river functions and the Minimum Water Demand for River Ecosystem (MWDRE), the water resources in the Lower Yellow River is further divided into three portions, i.e. water available for ecosystem (WE), water exploitable for socioeconomic purposes (WS) and excess flood water (WF). Corresponding conceptions and practical significances are expounded in details. The annual amount of the three portions of water resources from 1950 to 2001 is worked out on the basis of the daily hydrologic data, and the division of different portions is discussed. The results indicate that although the essential water demand for river functions is considered preferentially, the amount of the WE has decreased dramatically while its proportion increased gradually since the 1950s, and the shortage to the MWDRE increased markedly; both the amount and the proportion of the WS decreased notably. Since the 1990s, the actual water consumption for socioeconomic purposes in the lower reaches of the river basin has already exceeded the maximum amount of the WS and has to take over the WE which is already insufficient, hence not only the normal river functions are further disturbed and the river course shrinks greatly, but also the proportion and potential danger of the WIF show no decreasing tendency in spite of the sharp decrease of upstream runoff.},

Here we apply causal discovery algorithms to sea level pressure data from a large set of climate model simulations and, as a proxy for observations, meteorological reanalyses. We demonstrate how the resulting causal networks (fingerprints) offer an objective pathway for process-oriented model evaluation. Models with fingerprints closer to observations better reproduce important precipitation patterns over highly populated areas such as the Indian subcontinent, Africa, East Asia, Europe and North America. We further identify expected model interdependencies due to shared development backgrounds. Finally, our network metrics provide stronger relationships for constraining precipitation projections under climate change as compared to traditional evaluation metrics for storm tracks or precipitation itself. Such emergent relationships highlight the potential of causal networks to constrain longstanding uncertainties in climate change projections.},

Cooperation means that selfish replicators forgo some of their reproductive potential to help one another. But natural selection implies competition and therefore opposes cooperation unless a specific mechanism is at work. Here I discuss five mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, network reciprocity, and group selection. For each mechanism, a simple rule is derived that specifies whether natural selection can lead to cooperation.},

In this paper we bring together the emerging concept of telecoupled land systems and the established concept of polycentric governance to support the analysis and the development of sustainable land governance in interconnected social-ecological systems. We operationalize the two concepts by analyzing networks of action situations in which interactions between proximate and distant actors as well as socioeconomic and ecological processes cause land use change and affect the sustainability of land systems. To illustrate this integrated approach empirically, we analyze a case of transnational biofuel investment in Sierra Leone. We identify the characteristics of, and activities in, networks of action situations that affect the sustainability of land systems related to this case. Integration of the two concepts of telecoupled land systems and polycentric governance enables analysts to identify interactions in polycentric governance systems (1) as drivers of telecoupled sustainability problems and (2) as transformative approaches to such problems. The method provides one way for linking place-based analysis of land change with process-based analysis of land governance.},

  abstract = {Human water use can place considerable stress on hydrologic systems. Humans directly affect the water cycle through water withdrawals and return flows. Aside from climate change, humans indirectly impact hydrologic systems through dam building, land use change, and urbanization. Given the increasing incidence of water overdraft and water scarcity globally, there is a growing need to understand and quantify these effects so that appropriate water management and policy decisions can be made both in the United States and abroad. Massachusetts, in the northeastern United States, is located in a ``water-rich'' region, and yet issues of water overdraft and exceptional low flows have been documented throughout the state. This study demonstrates the application of water use regimes for characterizing the water balance in two suburbanized basins in eastern Massachusetts: The Charles River watershed (CRW) and the Ipswich River watershed (IRW). Water use regimes categorize river basins based on the magnitude of human water withdrawals and return flows relative to streamflow. Water use regimes for the upper/middle portions of the CRW and the IRW were examined at annual and subannual timescales for the period 2000\textendash 2004, which was the only time during which detailed water use data were available. Although the water use regimes of these watersheds displayed only minor alterations on an average annual scale, increased regime indicator values were noticeable at the annual scale of a low-flow (drought) year. At the subannual scale, water use intensity was low in high-flow months (e.g.,~April), but increased by more than an order of magnitude during low-flow months (e.g.,~August). A shift in water regime, from natural flow\textendash dominated toward withdrawal-dominated, was observed at the average monthly timescale and during the low-flow months of a single low-flow year. Despite the fact that the CRW and IRW are similar in their suburban characteristics and experience a similar climate, the two displayed different water use characteristics and variability in regime change. Therefore, water use characteristics and subannual variability in water regime shifts should be emphasized when examining the relationship between water use and water resource availability.},

Therefore, even though the stocks of water in natural and artificial reservoirs are helpful to increase the available water resources for human society, the flow of water should be the 01_manuscript focus in water resources assessments. The climate system puts an upper limit on the circulation rate of available renewable freshwater resources (RFWR). Although current global withdrawals are well below the upper limit, more than two billion people live in highly water-stressed areas because of the uneven distribution of RFWR in time and space. Climate change is expected to accelerate water cycles and thereby increase the available RFWR. This would slow down the increase of people living under water stress; however, changes in seasonal patterns and increasing probability of extreme events may offset this effect. Reducing current vulnerability will be the first step to prepare for such anticipated changes.},

The concept of virtual water and the quantitative estimates can help in assessing a more realistic water scarcity index in each country, projecting future water demand for food supply, increasing public awareness on water, and identifying the processes wasting water in the production. Really required water in exporting countries is generally smaller than virtually required water in importing countries, reflecting the comparative advantage of water use efficiency, and it is estimated to be 680 km3/y for 2000. On the contrary the virtually required water for the same year is estimated to be 1,130 km3/y, and the difference of 450 km3/y is virtually saved by global trade. However, solely virtual water should not be used for any decision making since the idea of virtual water implies only the usage and influence of water and no concerns on social, cultural, and environmental implications. Virtual water trade also does not consider other limiting factors than water.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Several theories posit that creative people are able to generate more divergent ideas. If this is correct, simply naming unrelated words and then measuring the semantic distance between them could serve as an objective measure of divergent thinking. To test this hypothesis, we asked 8,914 participants to name 10 words that are as different from each other as possible. A computational algorithm then estimated the average semantic distance between the words; related words (e.g., cat and dog) have shorter distances than unrelated ones (e.g., cat and thimble). We predicted that people producing greater semantic distances would also score higher on traditional creativity measures. In Study 1, we found moderate to strong correlations between semantic distance and two widely used creativity measures (the Alternative Uses Task and the Bridge-the-Associative-Gap Task). In Study 2, with participants from 98 countries, semantic distances varied only slightly by basic demographic variables. There was also a positive correlation between semantic distance and performance on a range of problems known to predict creativity. Overall, semantic distance correlated at least as strongly with established creativity measures as those measures did with each other. Naming unrelated words in what we call the Divergent Association Task can thus serve as a brief, reliable, and objective measure of divergent thinking.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Upon the continuation of these anthropogenic activities in the future, significant hydrological alteration is expected. This study takes a hydrological perspective on drought to project changes in the YRB drought risk under future LULCC and CWU business-as-usual (BAU) scenarios. A combination of seasonal trend forecasting, drought indices, land-use and hydrological modeling techniques was used. Future LULCC is assessed based on two BAU scenarios to explore the patterns of LULCC with (LULCC-BAU1) and without (LULCC-BAU2) the continuation of the Chinese Grain for Green Program. The results indicated that LULCC-BAU2 will increase the risk of mild and moderate droughts, while CWU and LULCC-BAU1 will impose higher risk of severe and extreme events. LULCC-BAU1 is projected to exacerbate the duration and intensity of the agricultural/hydrological droughts. The frequency of hydrological drought under LULCC-BAU1 and CWU scenarios is projected to increase by 43\% and 53\% during 2021\textendash 2050. The future agricultural droughts will likely be more intense and prolonged than meteorological droughts. Hydrological droughts, however, will be characterized by prolonged but less intense drought comparing to the metrological droughts. The meteorological to agricultural drought propagation will likely be driven by LULCC under BAU1, while the meteorological to hydrological drought propagation is controlled by CWU changes.},

  abstract = {Under global climate change and pressure from human activities, water scarcity is becoming a major concern in the quest for regional sustainable development in the Yellow River Basin (YRB). This study integrates scenarios of climate change and human activities under the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) with a watershed-scale hydrological model, and uses the Water Use-to-Availability Ratio (WUAR) to study future water scarcity over six sub-catchments in the YRB. It further investigates the relationship between the future water scarcity and hydroclimatic and anthropogenic drivers. The results suggest that the average WUAR under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 will likely exceed the water scarcity threshold (WUAR {$>$}20\%) and will reach up to 39.9 and 44.7\%, respectively. The average WUAR for the upstream and downstream sub-catchments will likely range from 23.8 to 51.6\% under RCP4.5 and from 255\% to 73.8\% under RCP8.5, indicating moderate to severe and moderate to extreme water scarcity, respectively. Future WUAR correlates negatively (r-value = -0.85) with the streamflow drought index (SDI) in the upstream sub-catchments, i.e., hydrological drought will likely intensify water scarcity. Conversely, WUAR and SDI would be positively correlated (r-value +0.70) in the downstream sub-catchments, i.e., water scarcity will become severer despite decreasing severity of hydrological drought. Under climate change, water scarcity in these sub-catchments will exhibit high dependency (Kendall T correlation coefficient = 0.84) on water-use patterns than on water availability. The regression analysis indicates that the WUAR will increase significantly (p {$<$} 0.05) with projected woodland, cropland, and buildup areas under RCP4.5. This relationship will become even more significant (p {$<$} 0.01) under RCP8.5. This study provides insights into the potential drivers of future water scarcity in the YRB, which is likely to confront water supply crises. The study should help policymaking towards attaining sustainable water management in the basin. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using indicators designed to measure a 'safe and just' development space, we quantify the resource use associated with meeting basic human needs, and compare this to downscaled planetary boundaries for over 150 nations. We find that no country meets basic needs for its citizens at a globally sustainable level of resource use. Physical needs such as nutrition, sanitation, access to electricity and the elimination of extreme poverty could likely be met for all people without transgressing planetary boundaries. However, the universal achievement of more qualitative goals (for example, high life satisfaction) would require a level of resource use that is 2-6 times the sustainable level, based on current relationships. Strategies to improve physical and social provisioning systems, with a focus on sufficiency and equity, have the potential to move nations towards sustainability, but the challenge remains substantial.},

The 01_manuscript hypothesis is that more invasions in a region are associated with lower investment, and in particular a bias towards annual crops as opposed to long-term crops. We use a county-level dataset for the state of Parana , Brazil, from 2003 to 2007, with 1,995 observations. The panel data structure allows us to control for fixed effects, such as the formalisation of land titles and land concentration, which might be correlated with the intensity of invasions. An instrumental variable fixed effects model was estimated to avoid other sources of bias. Our 01_manuscript finding is that land invasions are associated with lower long-term crop production and a higher percentage of annual crops, which could accelerate land degradation, and undermine environmental sustainability.},

  abstract = {Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing is prevalent globally and has detrimental effects on commercial fish stocks and nontarget species. Effective monitoring and enforcement aimed at reducing the level of IUU fishing in extensive, remote ocean fisheries requires international collaboration. Changes in trade and vessel activities further complicate enforcement. We used a web-based survey of governmental and nongovernmental organizations engaged in reducing IUU fishing in the Southern Ocean to collect information on interorganizational collaborations. We used social-network analyses to examine the nature of collaborations among the identified 117 organizations engaged in reducing IUU fishing. International collaboration improved the ability to control and manage harvest of commercially important toothfish (Dissostichus spp.) stocks and reduced bycatch of albatrosses (Diomedeidae) and petrels (Procellariidae) in longlines of IUU fishing vessels. The diverse group of surveyed organizations cooperated frequently, thereby making a wide range of resources available for improved detection of suspected IUU vessels and trade flows, cooperation aimed at prosecuting suspected offenders or developing new policy measures. Our results suggest the importance of a central agency for coordination and for maintaining commonly agreed-upon protocols for communication that facilities collaboration. Despite their differences, the surveyed organizations have developed common perceptions about key problems associated with IUU fishing. This has likely contributed to a sustained willingness to invest in collaborations. Our results show that successful international environmental governance can be accomplished through interorganizational collaborations. Such cooperation requires trust, continuous funding, and incentives for actors to participate.},

Both state control and privatisation of resources have been advocated, but neither the state nor the market have been uniformly successful in solving common pool resource problems. Offering a critique of the foundations of policy analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data to explore conditions under which common pool resource problems have been satisfactorily or unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom first describes three models most frequently used as the foundation for recommending state or market solutions.  She then outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to these models in order to illustrate the diversity of possible solutions. In the following chapters she uses institutional analysis to examine different ways - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the commons. In contrast to the proposition of the tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems sometimes are solved by voluntary organisations rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases considered are communal tenure in meadows and forests, irrigation communities and other water rights, and fisheries.},

  abstract = {The impact of anthropogenic activities in many deltas of the major rivers has caused considerable environmental change. The Yellow River (Huang He) delivers high sediment load to the sea, forming one of the fastest growing deltas worldwide. Population growth and rapid economic development have increased urbanization and wasteland cultivation, and threaten the natural environment of the delta. This is aggravated by the fact that a large amount of river water has been diverted for irrigation in the entire basin area, altering the river fluxes that are essential to maintain the health of the delta ecosystem. A supervised per-pixel classification approach using a decision tree algorithm was employed to generate land cover maps from Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery acquired in 1995, 2004, and 2010. Statistical analysis of the land cover classifications indicates large landscape changes in the Yellow River Delta from 1995 to 2010, with severe conversions of the natural environment as a result of increasing anthropogenic activities. Land cover changes were mainly caused by intensified farming and urban sprawl, with increases of 1803.1 km(2) and 237.0 km(2) respectively. Since the 1960s, economic development involved considerable increase of built-up areas (industries, infrastructure, and residential areas) around the major cities in the delta, displacing natural vegetation and arable lands. Changes in the coastal areas were closely associated with coastward expansion of aquaculture farming and salt production. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Purpose Humanity has been modifying the planet in a measurable way for thousands of years. Recently, this influence has been such that some feel we are in a new geological epoch, the Anthropocene. This review will describe how soil erosion and sediment dynamics have (i) been used to assess the impact of humans on the planet and (ii) affected the global climate and influenced water security. Emphasis is placed on changes since the middle of the twentieth century, as this coincides with what many suggest is the start of the Anthropocene Epoch. Results and discussion The use of sediment archives has been instrumental in our understanding of how environmental systems have developed over time, both naturally and in response to anthropogenic activities. Additional information has come from measurement and monitoring programs, and tracing and fingerprinting studies. In turn, models have been developed that enable forecasting. Some of the 01_manuscript global impacts of enhanced soil erosion and changes in sediment dynamics and sediment composition include: changes in radiative energy balances and impacts on the cryosphere; the global carbon cycle; and greenhouse gas emissions. Impacts on water security include: effects on freshwater biota, including wild salmon populations; fluxes of contaminants, including microplastics; and reservoir and river channel sedimentation, including flooding. Sediment archives and monitoring programs have also been used to document the effect of mitigation measures and environmental policies. Conclusion Sediment archives enable us to assemble information over a variety of timescales (i.e., 100 to 105 years and longer) and a range of spatial scales (from sub-watershed to continental), in addition to environments ranging from arid to tropical to polar. Often the temporal resolution is better than other paleoenvironmental reconstruction approaches. As such, sedimentary records, when combined with measurement and monitoring approaches and other sources of information, have enabled us to determine changes in atmospheric, terrestrial, and aquatic systems, especially over the last 100 years. While soil erosion and sediment dynamics have provided a wealth of information and greatly enhanced our understanding of the role of humanity in modifying the planet, suggestions are given for further research.},

  abstract = {The social-ecological systems framework (SESF) is arguably the most comprehensive conceptual framework for diagnosing interactions and outcomes in social-ecological systems (SES). This article systematically reviews the literature applying and developing the SESF and discusses methodological challenges for its continued use and development. Six types of research approaches using the SESF are identified, as well as the context of application, types of data used, and commonly associated concepts. The frequency of how each second-tier variable is used across articles is analyzed. A summary list of indicators used to measure each second-tier variable is provided. Articles suggesting modifications to the framework are summarized and linked to the specific variables. The discussion reflects on the results and focuses on methodological challenges for applying the framework. First, how the SESF is historically related to commons and collective action research. This affects its continued development in relation to inclusion criteria for variable modification and discourse in the literature. The framework may evolve into separate modified versions for specific resource use sectors (e.g., forestry, fisheries, food production, etc.), and a general framework would aggregate the generalizable commonalities between them. Methodological challenges for applying the SESF are discussed related to research design, transparency, and cross-case comparison. These are referred to as ``methodological gaps'' that allow the framework to be malleable to context but create transparency, comparability, and data abstraction issues. These include the variable-definition gap, variable-indicator gap, the indicator-measurement gap, and the data transformation gap. A benefit of the framework has been its ability to be malleable and multipurpose, bringing a welcomed pluralism of methods, data, and associated concepts. However, pluralism creates challenges for synthesis, data comparison, and mutually agreed-upon methods for modifications. Databases are a promising direction forward to help solve this problem. In conclusion, future research is discussed by reflecting on the different ways the SESF may continue to be a useful tool through (1) being a general but adaptable framework, (2) enabling comparison, and (3) as a diagnostic tool for theory building.},

  abstract = {Urban water systems are highly engineered. However, hydrology and ecology are still closely linked in semi-arid urban ecosystems in which surface characteristics, vegetation, and water flows are all highly transformed. Although these systems are human-dominated, there are many uncertainties in the water budgets of semi-arid cities, because evapotranspiration, runoff, groundwater recharge, and leakage are poorly constrained. Decision-making, governance, and socioeconomic factors play important roles in determining urban hydrologic budgets. We offer a framework to integrate these factors in studies that combine biophysical and social dimensions of the urban water system using the example of western US cities, which are facing critical issues in water supply and demand, and which can benefit from a more comprehensive understanding of the factors that determine water consumption, distribution and availability. Because of the severity of the water crisis in the western US, and the biophysical, institutional, and cultural barriers to developing and implementing new water management practices, this region provides useful lessons for addressing water challenges in other regions.

  abstract = {Quantifying the impacts of climate change on the hydrology and ecosystem is important in the study of the Loess Plateau, China, which is well known for its high erosion rates and ecosystem sensitivity to global change. A distributed ecohydrological model was developed and applied in the Jinghe River basin of the Loess Plateau. This model couples the vegetation model, BIOME BioGeochemicalCycles (BIOME-BGC) and the distributed hydrological model, Water and Energy transfer Process in Large river basins (WEP-L). The WEP-L model provided hydro-meteorological data to BIOME-BGC, and the vegetation parameters of WEP-L were updated at a daily time step by BIOME-BGC. The model validation results show good agreement with field observation data and literature values of leaf area index (LAI), net primary productivity (NPP) and river discharge. Average climate projections of 23 global climate models (GCMs), based on three emissions scenarios, were used in simulations to assess future ecohydrological responses in the Jinghe River basin. The results show that global warming impacts would decrease annual discharge and flood season discharge, increase annual NPP and decrease annual net ecosystem productivity (NEP). Increasing evapotranspiration (ET) due to air temperature increase, as well as increases in precipitation and LAI, are the 01_manuscript reasons for the decreasing discharge. The increase in annual NPP is caused by a greater increase in gross primary productivity (GPP) than in plant respiration, whilst the decrease in NEP is caused by a larger increase in heterotrophic respiration than in NPP. Both the air temperature increase and the precipitation increase may affect the changes in NPP and NEP. These results present a serious challenge for water and land management in the basin, where mitigation/adaption measures for climate change are desired. Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz; Associate editor D.

  abstract = {Since the 1950s, reforestation has been widely applied in the Loess Plateau in China as a soil and water conservation measure. We examine the eco-hydrologic responses to reforestation in two neighbouring catchments in the Loess Plateau using Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System. We use limited observed streamflow and other eco-hydrologic data to support and evaluate the model implementation and then apply the model to disentangle the relative roles played by inter-annual variation and longer-term trends in climate drivers and re-growth following reforestation. Our model-based analysis of trends in forest water use highlights the differences in the response of control and reforested catchments to similar declines in annual precipitation in this region over the past decades. Model estimates show that while reforestation does increase vegetation water use, the impacts on streamflow are small relative to the impact of precipitation trends on streamflow, and forest water use. Results illustrate how catchment differences in response to climate trends can confound interpretation of observed streamflow patterns in a paired catchment setting. Results also show that the greatest impact of reforestation is likely to be on groundwater recharge but also suggest that evaporation rather than transpiration is a significant contributor to hydrologic change. We also examine how declining trends in precipitation impact forest productivity. While the impact of historical precipitation declines on forest primary productivity is probably minor, model estimates suggest that forests are nearing a threshold above which further declines in precipitation will lead to more ecologically significant responses.

The characteristics and mechanism of debris flow were explored in this study via survey, numerical simulation, and simulation analysis in a Loess Plateau area (Huangling County, Shaanxi Province, China). Numerical models and formulas corresponding to the occurrence and movement mechanism were established based on the HEC-RAS, HEC-GeoRAS, and SWAT results. The range of debris flow deposition was determined through capturing the debris flow free surface. A hydrological model and critical rainfall threshold were determined in order to provide technical support for debris flow forecasting in the Loess Plateau. The results suggest that 10-year floods do not submerge any portion of the basin. One village area was affected by the 100-year flood (total area of 0.648 km(2)) while four villages areas were submerged by the 1000-year flood (total area of 1.39 km(2)). The method presented here may provide a reliable scientific basis for mitigating loss due to debris flow hazards.},

And in such instances, methods of statistical physics and network science can be used to quantify and to better understand what it is that evokes that pleasant feeling, be it when reading a book or looking at a painting. Indeed, recent large-scale explorations of digital data have lifted the veil on many aspects of our artistic expressions that would remain forever hidden in smaller samples. From the determination of complexity and entropy of art paintings to the creation of the flavour network and the principles of food pairing, fascinating research at the interface of art, physics and network science abounds. We here review the existing literature, focusing in particular on culinary, visual, musical and literary arts. We also touch upon cultural history and culturomics, as well as on the connections between physics and the social sciences in general. The review shows that the synergies between these fields yield highly entertaining results that can often be enjoyed by layman and experts alike. In addition to its wider appeal, the reviewed research also has many applications, ranging from improved recommendation to the detection of plagiarism.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River Delta wetland is the youngest wetland ecosystem in China's warm temperate zone. To better understand how its landscape pattern has changed over time and the underlying factors responsible, this study analyzed the dynamic changes of wetlands using five Landsat series of images, namely MSS (Mulri Spectral Scanner), TM (Thematic Mapper), and OLI (Operational Land Imager) sensors in 1976, 1986, 1996, 2006, and 2016. Object-oriented classification and the combination of spatial and spectral features and both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), as well as brightness characteristic indices, were used to classify the images in eCognition software. Landscape pattern changes in the Yellow River Delta over the past 40 years were then delineated using transition matrix and landscape index methods. Results show that: 1) from 1976 to 2016, the total area of wetlands in the study area decreased from 2594.76 to 2491.79 km(2), while that of natural wetlands decreased by 954.03 km(2) whereas human-made wetlands increased by 851.06 km(2). 2) The transformation of natural wetlands was extensive: 31.34\% of those covered by Suaeda heteropteras were transformed into reservoirs and ponds, and 24.71\% with Phragmites australis coverage were transformed into dry farmland. Some human-made wetlands were transformed into non-wetlands types: 1.55\% of reservoirs and ponds became construction land, and likewise 21.27\% were transformed into dry farmland. 3) From 1976 to 2016, as the intensity of human activities increased, the number of landscape types in the study area continuously increased. Patches were scattered and more fragmented. The whole landscape became more complex. In short, over the past 40 years, the wetlands of the Yellow River Delta have been degraded, with the area of natural wetlands substantially reduced. Human activities were the dominant forces driving these changes in the Yellow River Delta.},

We use a simple general growth model to analyze four cases that involve combinations of stock collapse versus changes in system dynamics, and exogenous versus endogenous probabilities of regime shift. Prior work in economics has focused on stock collapse with endogenous probabilities and reaches ambiguous conclusions on whether the potential for regime shift will increase or decrease intensity of resource use and level of resource stock. We show that all other cases yield unambiguous results. In particular, with endogenous probability of regime shift that affects system dynamics the potential for regime shift causes optimal management to become precautionary in the sense of maintaining higher resource stock levels.

The recently adopted Sustainable Development Goals set forward an ambitious agenda of providing universal access to good quality water supply and sanitation services within a financially constrained environment: however, the various peculiarities of each country regarding water governance makes it difficult to identify and implement the best practices and benchmarks. Drawing together empirical studies from countries around the world, the editors and contributors combine extensive data to review the individual challenges facing each country, from the supervision of autonomous regulatory bodies to the question of centralization and the influence of local utility companies. This pioneering and practical volume will be of interest and value not only to students and scholars of water governance, but also to practitioners and regulators.},

It distinguishes four sources of social capital and examines their dynamics. Applications of the concept in the sociological literature emphasize its role in social control, in family support, and in benefits mediated by extrafamilial networks. I provide examples of each of these positive functions. Negative consequences of the same processes also deserve attention for a balanced picture of the forces at play. I review four such consequences and illustrate them with relevant examples. Recent writings on social capital have extended the concept from an individual asset to a feature of communities and even nations. The final sections describe this conceptual stretch and examine its limitations. I argue that, as shorthand for the positive consequences of sociability, social capital has a definite place in sociological theory. However, excessive extensions of the concept may jeopardize its heuristic value.},

  abstract = {Drylands, a critical terrestrial system of the Earth due to low water availability, are known for their extensive global reach, estimated by most scientific sources at approximately 41\% of the world's land area, or \textasciitilde{} 60 mil km2. However, the analysis of the global dryland areas, using new climate data, suggests a total of \textasciitilde 45\% of the Earth's terrestrial area, almost 7 mil km2 more than initially estimated. This new spatial dimension involves a wide range of environmental issues, some of which have yet to be associated with these critical global systems. This paper primarily aims to accurately quantify the global, continental and national extent of drylands by using a high-resolution climate database presently available at global level. Also, based on relevant scientific literature, this approach attempts to briefly highlight the 01_manuscript environmental issues (natural and anthropogenic) of the major continental and regional dryland areas. In this respect, special attention was given to the land degradation processes (water and wind erosion, vegetation degradation, salinization, soil compaction and nutrient loss), as it is known to be the 01_manuscript environmental perturbation in almost all dryland systems. Research shows that, given the fact that Africa and Asia have the most extensive dryland systems on Earth (each of them has almost 23 mil km2, or \textasciitilde 15\% of the global land area), these continents are especially threatened by major environmental perturbations (desertification, in addition to other ecological and climatic disturbances such as drought, dust storms, heat waves, water stress, extreme rainfall events, wildfire, dzud, or disease emergence), which are currently affecting 46 African states (37\% of the 126 states affected by aridity worldwide) and 38 Asian states (30\%). Given this context, anthropogenic systems are indirectly severely threatened by the crisis generated by soaring poverty, food insecurity, population migration, and escalating conflicts and regional political instability. Moreover, in the current context of large-scale aridity identified at high latitudes, another critical threat reviewed was the cryosphere's destabilization, which can potentially accelerate climate warming by means of positive feedback mechanisms that can be triggered in the global climate system. In this respect, a major concern is attributed to permafrost melting that, against the background of a significant expansion in the terrestrial northern hemisphere (in Russia, Alaska and Canada), can generate a massive acceleration of climate warming due to the potential release of large quantities of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), which are currently stored in these frozen soils in the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions.},

This typology clusters together similar underlying organizing principles of the features and attributes of CAS, and serves as a heuristic framework for identifying methods and approaches that account for the key features of SES. These principles can help identify appropriate methods and approaches for studying SES. We discuss three 01_manuscript implications of studying and engaging with SES as CAS. First, there needs to be a shift in focus when studying the dynamics and interactions in SES, to better capture the nature of the organizing principles that characterize SES behavior. Second, realizing that the nature of the intertwined social-ecological relations is complex has real consequences for how we choose methods and practical approaches for observing and studying SES interactions. Third, engagement with SES as CAS poses normative challenges for problemoriented researchers and practitioners taking on real-world challenges.},

  abstract = {The Loess Plateau, which is located in the arid and semi-arid areas of China, experiences significant soil erosion due to intense human activities and soil erodibility. It is necessary to explore and identify the land-use types or land-use patterns that can control soil erosion and achieve certain agricultural production capabilities. This study established runoff plots with two slope gradients (5 and 15) in north of Yan'an, one area of the Loess Plateau, with 3 single land-use types (cultivated land, CL; switchgrass, SG; and abandoned land, AL) and 2 composite land-use types (CL-SG and CL-AL). From 2006 to 2012, we continuously monitored the rainfall characteristics, runoff depth, soil loss, vegetation coverage, and soil physical properties. The results indicated a general trend in the number of runoff and soil loss events for the 5 land-use types: CL = CL-SG {$>$} CL-AL {$>$} SG{$>$} AL. The general trend for runoff depth, soil loss, their magnitudes of variation, and the slopes of rainfall-runoff regression equation was CL {$>$} CL-SG {$>$} CL-AL {$>$} SG {$>$} AL, whereas the rainfall threshold for runoff generation exhibited the opposite trend. Results of nonparametric test regarding runoff depth/Elio and soil loss/EI30, where EI30 is the product of rainfall kinetic energy and the maximum rainfall intensity over 30 min, and the runoff depth-soil loss relationship regression indicated that the effect of CL-AL was similar to that of SG; SG was similar to AL; and CL-AL, SG, and AL were superior to CL with regard to soil and water conservation. Runoff depth and soil loss significantly increased as the slope gradient increased. Runoff depth and soil loss were significantly correlated with the soil particle size composition and bulk density, respectively. The strongest significant correlations were found between runoff depth and vegetation coverage as well as between soil loss and vegetation coverage, which showed that vegetation coverage was the primary factor controlling soil erosion. Therefore, the composite land-use type CL-AL and the artificial grassland (SG) are appropriate options because both soil conservation and a certain degree of agricultural production are necessary in the study area.},

However, these studies were mainly conducted in the hill and gully region of the Loess Plateau, while studies on other regions, such as the tableland and gully region, which is more important for food production, and social and economic development, have rarely been reported. In this study, a typical watershed in this region was selected to analyze the changes in the sediment load between 1981 and 2016, and the contributions of its influencing factors. The Mann-Kendall (MK) test was applied to annual runoff and sediment load, and the year 1994 was identified as the year of mutation; thus, a baseline period (1981-1994) and a response period (1995-2016) were distinguished. By combined use of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Sediment Delivery Distributed Model (SEDD), sediment yields for the two periods were estimated, and compared with the corresponding measured data. The contributions of influencing factors, including natural factors (changes in rainfall and rainfall erosivisty) and anthropogenic activities (human induced vegetation change, slope terraced farmlands, and check dams in the stream networks), were analyzed. The results demonstrate that; 1) Sediment load in Yanwachuan watershed decreased substantially between the two periods; 2) Sediment load change was mainly influenced by human induced vegetation cover changes across the watershed, and check dams in the stream networks, which accounted for approximately 80\% and 20\% of the sediment load reduction, respectively; 3) The sediment trapped by the check dams are likely to increase in the future, thus effective measures should be implemented to protect check dams, and to ensure the effects of check dams on sediment reduction can be maximized. The results of this study help to understand the changes in sediment load in the tableland and gully region, and can provide valuable guidance on best practices in terms of local soil conservation management.},

However, some consumptive uses of water are more or less flexible than others, depending on the costs or effects associated with their curtailment. Here, we estimate the share of global water consumption over the period 1980\textendash 2016 from the relatively inflexible demands of irrigating perennial crops, cooling thermal power plants, storing water in reservoirs and supplying basic water for humans and livestock. We then construct a water stress index that integrates the share of runoff being consumed (scarcity), the share of consumption in these inflexible categories (flexibility) and the historical variability of runoff weighted by storage capacity (variability), and use our index to evaluate the trends in water stress of global major river basins on six continents. We find that the 10\% most stressed basins encompass \textasciitilde 19\%, 19\% and 35\% of global population, thermal electricity generation and irrigated calorie production, respectively, and some of these basins also experience the largest increases in our identified stress indexes over the study period. Water consumption intensities (water used per unit of goods or service produced) vary by orders of magnitude across and within continents, with highly stressed basins in some cases characterized by high water consumption intensities. Our results thus point to targeted water mitigation opportunities (for example, relocating crops and switching cooling technologies) for highly stressed basins.},

This study analyzed the trends of streamflow, precipitation, air temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) from 1962 to 2008 in the Jihe watershed in northwestern Loess Plateau of China using the Mann-Kendall test. The streamflow responses to climate change and LUCC were quantified independently by the elasticity method. The results show that the streamflow presented a dramatic decline with a turning point occurred in 1971, while the precipitation and PET did not change significantly. The results also show that the temperature rose markedly especially since 1990s with an approximate increase of 1.74A degrees C over the entire research period (1962-2008). Using land use transition matrix, we found that slope cropland was significantly converted to terrace between 1970s and 1990s and that forest cover increased relatively significantly because of the Grain for Green Project after 2000. The streamflow reduction was predominantly caused by LUCC and its contribution reached up to 90.2\%, while the contribution of climate change to streamflow decline was only 9.8\%. Although the analytical results between the elasticity method and linear regression model were not satisfactorily consistent, they both indicated that LUCC (human activity) was the major factor causing streamflow decline in the Jihe watershed from 1962 to 2008.},

  abstract = {The global climate change and intensification of human activities in recent decades have made profound changes in hydrological cycle processes and water resources, and produced serious water problems and water crisis in many areas. The 01_manuscript reason is that the driving force of water cycle, the structure of water cycle, and the parameters of water cycle have dualistically evolved under the influence of human activities, and consequently resulted in reduction of runoff water resources, water pollution, and degradation of natural ecosystems. In order to realize of the safety aim of water supply, water environment, and ecosystem in area which is short of water resources, scientific regulation of water resources must take basin water cycle system as the unified base, and the first scientific basis is the awareness of the internal mechanism and law of water cycle evolution under highly intensive human activities. This article discussed four aspects of dualistic water cycle evolution, including its history in China, its theory, its characteristics in a typical basin, and its description of integral structure, along with the conceptive model system to quantify it. This article can be a reference to the basic cognition of water cycle evolution in a changing environment, and the study of water resources reduction reasons in the contemporary age.},

  abstract = {The hydrological effects of the "Grain for Green" project (GFGP) on the Loess Plateau have been extensively debated due to the complexity of the water system and its multiple driving factors. The aim of this study was to investigate the response of the hydrological cycle to the GFGP measures based in a case study of the Yanhe Basin, a typical hilly-gully area on the Loess Plateau of China. First, we analyzed the land use and land cover (LULC) changes from 1990 to 2010. Then, we evaluated the effects of LULC changes and sloping land conversion on the 01_manuscript hydrological components in the basin using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT). The results indicated that cropland exhibited a decreasing trend, declining from 40.2\% of the basin area in 1990 to 17.6\% in 2010, and that the woodland and grassland areas correspondingly increased. With the land use changes from 1990 to 2010, the water yield showed a decreasing trend which was mainly due to decrease in surface runoff. In contrast, evapotranspiration (ET) showed an increasing trend over the same period, resulting in a persistent decrease in soil water. The conversion of sloping cropland to grassland or woodland exerted negative effects on water yield and soil water. Compared with the land use condition in 2010, the negative effects were most evident where cropland with a slope {$>$}= 15 degrees was converted to woodland, with decreases in surface runoff and soil water of 17.1 and 6.4 \%, respectively. These results suggest that the expansive reforestation on sloping land in the loess hilly-gully region decreased water yield and increased ET, resulting in reduced soil water. The results of this study can be used to support sustainable land use planning and water resource management on the Loess Plateau in China.},

Communicating the SLCP outcomes across diverse stakeholder groups in ecological, socio-economic, political and institutional contexts can facilitate the effective implementation of the new round of the SLCP. Experts from various fields involved in the SLCP have developed good connections with governments, agencies, and farmers; therefore they can play an invaluable role in informing urgent policy changes. This study is based upon 24 interviews with the SLCP experts with the aims of assessing their perceptions of ecological, economic, political and social impacts of the SLCP on the Loess Plateau of China, and then gathering their policy recommendations to ensure that the new round of the SLCP would be implemented efficiently. Content analysis based on the grounded theory is used in present study. Judging from expert-based consensual statements from this study's interviews, the 01_manuscript concerns about the first round of the SLCP on the Loess Plateau are that the dramatic increase in the farmer's income and livelihood is mainly from off-farm sources rather than the SLCP subsidy, that equitable government compensation is dependent on the outcome of the SLCP, that the aggressive SLCP causes soil drought which have negative effects on ecological restoration, and that the stakeholders' interaction could be improved. Based on the analyses of the experts' interviews, the recommendations are summarised as follows: strengthening the farmers' environmental awareness and vocational skills, establishing multi-source financial supports and flexible compensation mechanisms, establishing participatory planning that requires stakeholder involvement especially farmers and insisting that scientific studies on the ecological restoration of the Loess Plateau must be shared with local governments and farmers.},

Importantly, ties in these networks often are dynamic, changing in response to the behavior of one's social partners. This dynamic structure permits an important form of conditional action that has been explored theoretically but has received little empirical attention: People can respond to the cooperation and defection of those around them by making or breaking network links. Here, we present experimental evidence of the power of using strategic link formation and dissolution, and the network modification it entails, to stabilize cooperation in sizable groups. Our experiments explore large-scale cooperation, where subjects' cooperative actions are equally beneficial to all those with whom they interact. Consistent with previous research, we find that cooperation decays over time when social networks are shuffled randomly every round or are fixed across all rounds. We also find that, when networks are dynamic but are updated only infrequently, cooperation again fails. However, when subjects can update their network connections frequently, we see a qualitatively different outcome: Cooperation is maintained at a high level through network rewiring. Subjects preferentially break links with defectors and form new links with cooperators, creating an incentive to cooperate and leading to substantial changes in network structure. Our experiments confirm the predictions of a set of evolutionary game theoretic models and demonstrate the important role that dynamic social networks can play in supporting large-scale human cooperation.},

Our understanding of the effects of terraces on soil and water conservation and its mechanism is limited by observation data on runoff and soil erosion as well as the influences from local environmental characteristics. In this study, we applied a physically-based distributed hydrological model (Integrated Hydrology Model, InHM) to an experimental terrace in Wangmaogou watershed, in the center of the Loess Plateau which attributed most of the sediment in the Yellow River. The soil water content were measured at daily scale for one month, while the simulations were conducted at second time step. Our results suggested that terrace construction can substantially reduce runoff by changing the flow direction, especially during heavy rainfall events. This reduction in runoff would be greatly attenuated when ridges are damaged due to lack of maintenance. Under the rainfall intensity of 120 mm/h, compared with hillslope, a well-maintained terrace could reduce runoff by 100\%, while the terrace without ridges could only reduce 28\% runoff. Besides, ridges not only prevented water from flowing out of platforms, but also helped maintain the risers from terrace failure by decreasing about 20\% of the saturation rate at the risers. Our results also emphasized the importance of evapotranspiration, which could make up to 15\% of the total water loss even during the rainfall events. Given the effects of terraces on water conservation, it is essential for the land use management of the Loess Plateau to take into account of the terracing approach, as well as a good maintenance of ridges.},

  abstract = {Water shortage has severely threatened the North China Plain (NCP), a typical grain bowl and highly populated and urbanized area in China. As surface water body area (SWA) is a critical variable for measuring regional water resources, understanding its changes and driving mechanisms is important for sustainable water management. Here, we examine the interannual variations and trends of SWA in the NCP during 1987\textendash 2020 by using all the available Landsat imagery, the water indices- and threshold-based water mapping algorithm, and cloud computing platform Google Earth Engine (GEE). The results show that SWA of the NCP significantly (  p  {$<$}0.05) expanded by 68.0\% (from 4,740.0 km  2   in 1987 to 7,963.7 km  2   in 2020) at a rate of 101.9 km  2  /yr. The most remarkable expansion of SWA happened in Shandong Province (75.0 km  2  /yr), which is an increasingly important aquaculture production region. We find that the increasing artificial reservoirs/lakes due to the implementation of water projects, together with aquaculture development, are the 01_manuscript drivers for the expansion of SWA in the NCP. The expansion of SWA caused a significant increase in water evaporation (0.09 km  3  /yr) in the NCP as the shallow nature of these artificial reservoirs/lakes and aquaculture ponds could lead to excess evaporation because of the frequent heating and cooling cycles due to their limited abilities to store energy. Similarly, Shandong Province experienced the most rapid increase in water evaporation (0.03 km  3  /yr), which could accelerate the loss of water storage at a rate of 8.4\textendash 14.4 mm/yr in the regions covered by surface water bodies. Continuous temperature rise (0.02\textendash 0.06   o  C/yr) in the future, as predicted by the climate models (CMIP5) under the two Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios of medium (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) greenhouse gas emission, could further increase water evaporation, which may add more pressure to regional water shortage. This study warns that, despite an observed significant SWA expansion, water shortage remains a major concern in the NCP.},

A regime is a characteristic behaviour of a system which is maintained by mutually reinforced processes or feedbacks. Regimes are considered persistent relative to the time period over which the shift occurs. The change of regimes, or the shift, usually occurs when a smooth change in an internal process (feedback) or a single disturbance (external shocks) triggers a completely different system behavior. Although such non-linear changes have been widely studied in different disciplines ranging from atoms to climate dynamics, regime shifts have gained importance in ecology because they can substantially affect the flow of ecosystem services that societies rely upon, such as provision of food, clean water or climate regulation. Moreover, regime shift occurrence is expected to increase as human influence on the planet increases \textendash{} the Anthropocene \textendash{} including current trends on human induced climate change and biodiversity loss. When regime shifts are associated with a critical or bifurcation point, they may also be referred to as critical transitions.},

By applying the geostatistics analysis method to grain size parameters in determining the characteristic distance in the sediment trend analysis method, an effective way to understand the movement and gradation of surface sediments around the delta has been proposed. The results show that as a whole the sediment in the inshore erosion area is coarser than that in the offshore accretion area. The grain size trends obtained reveal two converging zones of sediment movement. We find a coarsening trend in sediment from 2000 to 2007. Possible mechanisms for this trend are discussed.},

Here, we compare the ecology, economy, and social network of a community of traditional fishers in the Brazilian Pantanal between the dry season and the flood season in which their wetland ecosystem is transformed. Using data derived from satellite imaging we show that during the flood season of 2019 the total amount of open water accessible to fishers more than doubled and led to drastic qualitative changes. We show that although fishers adapted to this extreme seasonality by changing where, how, and what they fish between seasons, the structure of the social network in our study community did not differ. We argue that strong networks are especially important in social-ecological systems with extreme seasonal changes. More generally, we suggest that case studies of seasonal adaptation such as ours can contribute to a broader understanding of how communities may be able to successfully adapt to novel social-ecological changes.},

Four insights from contemporary SES literature on (a) intertwined SES, (b) cross-scale dynamics, (c) systemic tipping points, and (d) transformational change are explored. Based on these insights, shifts in sustainable development practice are suggested to recognize and govern the complex and codeveloping social and ecological aspects of development challenges. The potential susceptibility of SES to nonlinear systemic reconfigurations is highlighted, as well as the opportunities, agency, and capacities required to foster reconfigurative transformations for sustainable development. SES research proposes the need for diverse values and beliefs that are more in tune with the deep, dynamic connections between social and ecological systems to transform development practice and to support capacities to deal with shocks and surprises. From these perspectives, SES research offers new outlooks, practices, and novel opportunity spaces from which to address the challenges of the Anthropocene.},

As atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations continue to rise as a result of fossil fuel burning, human activity could also trigger tipping, and the impacts would be difcult to adapt to. Previous studies report low global warming thresholds above pre-industrial conditions for key tipping 01_manuscript such as ice-sheet melt. If so, high contemporary rates of warming imply that exceeding these thresholds is almost inevitable, which is widely assumed to mean that we are now committed to sufering these tipping events. Here we show that this assumption may be fawed, especially for slow-onset tipping 01_manuscript (such as the collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) in our rapidly changing climate. Recently developed theory indicates that a threshold may be temporarily exceeded without prompting a change of system state, if the overshoot time is short compared to the efective timescale of the tipping element. To demonstrate this, we consider transparently simple models of tipping 01_manuscript with prescribed thresholds, driven by global warming trajectories that peak before returning to stabilize at a global warming level of 1.5 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial level. These results highlight the importance of accounting for timescales when assessing risks associated with overshooting tipping point thresholds.},

More recently, these grasslands have undergone widespread degradation, raising concern for securing local herders' livelihoods. To understand these changes in ecological and welfare outcomes over long time scales, we define five broad periods of relative institutional stability over the past millennium, characterize social-ecological system during each period, and then assess major changes between these periods. Looking at changes in institutional contexts helps explain some of our outcomes of interest. We find that while much attention has been given to the change in grassland lease structures in China, the role of market integration and buffers against historically natural constraints on livestock production (e.g., protection from the winter months) have decoupled formerly tight local social-ecological links. This decoupling, along with weak land tenure security due to a complex and volatile policy landscape, suppresses local incentives for grassland conservation.},

In the last few years the concept of integrated water resources management (IWRM) has been accepted as a means to ensure equitable, economically sound and environmentally sustainable management of water resources and provision of water services. This approach is defined by GWP as: a process which promotes the co-ordinated development and management of water, land and related resources, in order to maximise the resultant economic and social welfare in an equitable manner without compromising the sustainability of vital eco-systems (GWP, 2000). IWRM demands a new framework within which there may be a need for significant changes in existing interactions between politics, laws, regulations, institutions, civil society, and the consumer-voter. The capacity to make these changes depends therefore on changes in governance.},

Even when the written word comes into play in human history and we can read the hieroglyphs naming an Egyptian pharaoh and describing royal achievements, the majority of human experience remains unknown and unrecoverable. Archaeologists usually excavate to gather physical evidence from ruins, monuments, and artifacts, which become data streams for the interpretation of past societies. Basic excavation is supplemented by a variety of scientific and historical research methods, all of which are far removed from observing the actual experiences of individuals in the past. Fig. 1.  Agent-based modeling is a powerful means for archeologists to explore the connections among individual action, intangible social entities, and broader interpretations at any time scale. If used more widely, ABM could free practitioners from many traditional limitations and make findings translatable to the general scientific public.

The result is that aggregated categories such as households, neighborhoods, cities, nations, and civilizations become the units of analysis. These categories are incredibly important, but they are often used because finer analytical levels are unavailable. Furthermore, the aggregate categories are typically implemented under expectations of classical science, such as equilibrium outcomes that assume normal distributions as well as linear assumptions of cause and effect about rates of change or adaptive processes. These approaches only scratch the surface of complex human dynamics. Unless fine-grained behaviors can be accounted for, the use of standard inferences and analogies only adds more layers of unknown bias to interpretations. Essentially, the past is understood through conceptual tools developed before the mid-20th century.

In this regard, it has been increasingly recognised that a multiplicity of instruments \textendash{} or instrument mixes \textendash{} are needed to foster low-carbon transitions. In addition, over the past few years a broader conceptualization of policy mixes for sustainability transitions has emerged which we adopt in this special issue. Such a broader perspective not only examines the interaction of instruments, but also captures corresponding policy strategies with their long-term targets and pays greater attention to the associated policy processes. It also encompasses the analysis of overarching policy mix characteristics such as consistency, coherence or credibility, as well as policy design considerations. Furthermore, it embraces the analysis of actors and institutions involved in developing and implementing such policy mixes. To explicitly consider these further aspects of policy mixes, this special issue includes fifteen papers with different analytical perspectives drawing on a range of social science disciplines, such as environmental economics, innovation studies and policy sciences. It is our hope that the conceptual and empirical advances presented here will stimulate diverse future research and inform policy advice on policy mixes for energy transitions.},

  abstract = {Water scarcity is a global issue, affecting in excess of four billion people. Interbasin Water Transfer (IBWT) is an established method for increasing water supply by transferring excess water from one catchment to another, water-scarce catchment. The implementation of IBWT peaked in the 1980s and was accompanied by a robust academic debate of its impacts. A recent resurgence in the popularity of IBWT, and particularly the promotion of mega-scale schemes, warrants revisiting this technology. This paper provides an updated review, building on previously published work, but also incorporates learning from schemes developed since the 1980s. We examine the spatial and temporal distribution of schemes and their drivers, review the arguments for and against the implementation of IBWT schemes and examine conceptual models for assessing IBWT schemes. Our analysis suggests that IBWT is growing in popularity as a supply-side solution for water scarcity and is likely to represent a key tool for water managers into the future. However, we argue that IBWT cannot continue to be delivered through current approaches, which prioritise water-centric policies and practices at the expense of social and environmental concerns. We critically examine the Socio-Ecological Systems and Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus models as new conceptual models for conceptualising and assessing IBWT. We conclude that neither model offers a comprehensive solution. Instead, we propose an enhanced WEF model (eWEF) to facilitate a more holistic assessment of how these mega-scale engineering interventions are integrated into water management strategies. The proposed model will help water managers, decision-makers, IBWT funders and communities create more sustainable IBWT schemes.},

Intensification of rainfall cycles, ranging from frequent downpours to severe droughts, could cause widespread, but largely unknown, alterations to trophic structure and ecosystem function. We conducted multi-site coordinated experiments to show how variation in the quantity and evenness of rainfall modulates trophic structure in 210 natural freshwater microcosms (tank bromeliads) across Central and South America (18\textdegree N to 29\textdegree S). The biomass of smaller organisms (detritivores) was higher under more stable hydrological conditions. Conversely, the biomass of predators was highest when rainfall was uneven, resulting in top-heavy biomass pyramids. These results illustrate how extremes of precipitation, resulting in localized droughts or flooding, can erode the base of freshwater food webs, with negative implications for the stability of trophic dynamics.},

  abstract = {This study is focused on the water-agriculture-environment nexus as it played out in the Murrumbidgee River Basin, eastern Australia, and how coevolution of society and water management actually transpired. Over 100 years of agricultural development the Murrumbidgee Basin experienced a ``pendulum swing'' in terms of water allocation, initially exclusively for agriculture production changing over to reallocation back to the environment. In this paper, we hypothesize that in the competition for water between economic livelihood and environmental wellbeing, economic diversification was the key to swinging community sentiment in favor of environmental protection, and triggering policy action that resulted in more water allocation to the environment. To test this hypothesis, we developed a sociohydrology model to link the dynamics of the whole economy (both agriculture and industry composed of manufacturing and services) to the community's sensitivity toward the environment. Changing community sensitivity influenced how water was allocated and governed and how the agricultural sector grew relative to the industrial sector (composed of manufacturing and services sectors). In this way, we show that economic diversification played a key role in influencing the community's values and preferences with respect to the environment and economic growth. Without diversification, model simulations show that the community would not have been sufficiently sensitive and willing enough to act to restore the environment, highlighting the key role of sectoral transformation in achieving the goal of sustainable agricultural development.},

The results indicate that fishing constitutes a key source of food and income for fishers and their communities and that the impact of the dam on the fisheries will potentially extend much further than the officially recognized affected area. By ignoring the effects of the dams on downstream communities, impact assessments have severely underestimated the number of people who would be affected by the dams. Therefore, a thorough evaluation of downstream fishers needs to be conducted prior to river impoundment and be considered by development plans.},

Here, we introduce a novel method that flexibly combines linear or nonlinear conditional independence tests with a causal discovery algorithm to estimate causal networks from large-scale time series datasets. We validate the method on time series of well-understood physical mechanisms in the climate system and the human heart and using large-scale synthetic datasets mimicking the typical properties of real-world data. The experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in detection power, which opens up entirely new possibilities to discover and quantify causal networks from time series across a range of research fields.},

Recent work has focused on causal definitions of information transfer aimed at decompositions of predictive information about a target variable, while excluding effects of common drivers and indirect influences. While common drivers clearly constitute a spurious causality, the aim of the present article is to develop measures quantifying different notions of the strength of information transfer along indirect causal paths, based on first reconstructing the multivariate causal network. Another class of novel measures quantifies to what extent different intermediate processes on causal paths contribute to an interaction mechanism to determine pathways of causal information transfer. The proposed framework complements predictive decomposition schemes by focusing more on the interaction mechanism between multiple processes. A rigorous mathematical framework allows for a clear information-theoretic interpretation that can also be related to the underlying dynamics as proven for certain classes of processes. Generally, however, estimates of information transfer remain hard to interpret for nonlinearly intertwined complex systems. But if experiments or mathematical models are not available, then measuring pathways of information transfer within the causal dependency structure allows at least for an abstraction of the dynamics. The measures are illustrated on a climatological example to disentangle pathways of atmospheric flow over Europe.},

Each Transformation identifies priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for actions by well-defined parts of government working with business and civil society. Transformations may therefore be operationalized within the structures of government while respecting the strong interdependencies across the 17 SDGs.

We showed a significant reduction in system-wide resilience between previous Indigenous and historical colonial governance regimes, and limited change with the onset of the latest environmental justice era. We also detected recent signs of recovery among several metrics of resilience, thereby signaling that this system exhibits the preconditions for governance transformation.

We develop a social-psychological model of environmental decision making that addresses four key challenges of incorporating social science into integrated models. We use the model to explain preferences for three conservation policies designed to conserve and protect water resources and aquatic ecosystems in the Smoky Hill River Basin, a semiarid agricultural region in the Central U.S. Great Plains. Further, we compare the model's capacity to explain policy preferences among members of two groups in the River Basin: agricultural producers and members of nonfarming communities. We find that financial obligation is the strongest and most consistent explanation of support for conservation policies among members of both groups. We also find that policy support is grounded in cultural values\textemdash deeply held ideas about right and wrong. Environmental values are particularly important explanations of policy support. The constellations of values invoked to make decisions about policies, and the social-psychological pathways linking values to policy support, can vary across policies and types of agents (farmers and nonfarmers). We discuss the implications of the results for future research in sociohydrology.},

We argue that because the basis of the Budyko framework relies on the supply and demand concept, the framework could be effectively adapted and extended to quantify the role of drivers \textendash{} both changing climate and local human disturbances \textendash{} in altering the land-surface response across the globe. We review the Budyko framework, along with these potential extensions, with the intent of furthering the applicability of the framework to emerging hydrologic questions. Challenges in extending the Budyko framework over various spatiotemporal scales and the use of global datasets to evaluate the water balance at these various scales are also discussed.},

  abstract = {From group hunting to global warming, how to deal with collective action may be formulated in terms of a public goods game of cooperation. In most cases, contributions depend on the risk of future losses. Here, we introduce an evolutionary dynamics approach to a broad class of cooperation problems in which attempting to minimize future losses turns the risk of failure into a central issue in individual decisions. We find that decisions within small groups under high risk and stringent requirements to success significantly raise the chances of coordinating actions and escaping the tragedy of the commons. We also offer insights on the scale at which public goods problems of cooperation are best solved. Instead of large-scale endeavors involving most of the population, which as we argue, may be counterproductive to achieve cooperation, the joint combination of local agreements within groups that are small compared with the population at risk is prone to significantly raise the probability of success. In addition, our model predicts that, if one takes into consideration that groups of different sizes are interwoven in complex networks of contacts, the chances for global coordination in an overall cooperating state are further enhanced.},

We develop an empirical model to reconstruct observed damages and quantify the contributions of climate and socio-economic drivers to observed trends. We show that, on the level of nine world regions, trends in damages are dominated by increasing exposure and modulated by changes in vulnerability, while climate-induced trends are comparably small and mostly statistically insignificant, with the exception of South \& Sub-Saharan Africa and Eastern Asia. However, when disaggregating the world regions into subregions based on river-basins with homogenous historical discharge trends, climate contributions to damages become statistically significant globally, in Asia and Latin America. In most regions, we find monotonous climate-induced damage trends but more years of observations would be needed to distinguish between the impacts of anthropogenic climate forcing and multidecadal oscillations.},

  abstract = {Resource management boundaries seldom align with environmental systems, which can lead to social and ecological problems. Mapping and analyzing how resource management organizations in different areas collaborate can provide vital information to help overcome such misalignment. Few quantitative approaches exist, however, to analyze social collaborations alongside environmental patterns, especially among local and regional organizations (i.e., in multilevel governance settings). This paper develops and applies such an approach using social\textendash ecological network analysis (SENA), which considers relationships among and between social and ecological units. The framework and methods are shown using an estuary restoration case from Puget Sound, United States. Collaboration patterns and quality are analyzed among local and regional organizations working in hydrologically connected areas. These patterns are correlated with restoration practitioners' assessments of the productivity of their collaborations to inform network theories for natural resource governance. The SENA is also combined with existing ecological data to jointly consider social and ecological restoration concerns. Results show potentially problematic areas in nearshore environments, where collaboration networks measured by density (percentage of possible network connections) and productivity are weakest. Many areas also have high centralization (a few nodes hold the network together), making network cohesion dependent on key organizations. Although centralization and productivity are inversely related, no clear relationship between density and productivity is observed. This research can help practitioners to identify where governance capacity needs strengthening and jointly consider social and ecological concerns. It advances SENA by developing a multilevel approach to assess social\textendash ecological (or social\textendash environmental) misalignments, also known as scale mismatches.},

We take stock of this budding research area to further show the strength of SEN analysis for complex human-environment settings, identify future synergies between SEN and wider human-environment research, and provide guidance about when to use different kinds of SEN approaches and models. We characterize SEN research along a spectrum specifying the degree of explicit network representation of system components and dynamics. We then systematically review one end of this spectrum, what we term `fully articulated SEN' studies, which specifically model unique social and ecological units and relationships. Results show a larger number of papers focus on methodological advancement and applied ends. While there has been some development and testing of theories, this remains an area for future work and would help develop SENs as a unique field of research, not just a method. Authors have studied diverse systems, while mainly focusing on the problem of social-ecological fit alongside a scattering of other topics. There is strong potential, however, to engage other issues central to human-environment studies. Analyzing the simultaneous effects of multiple social, environmental, and coupled processes, change over time, and linking network structures to outcomes are also areas for future advancement. This review provides a comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN research, a necessary step that can help scholars develop comparable cases and fill research gaps.},

Although diverse events can trigger such shifts, recent studies show that a loss of resilience usually paves the way for a switch to an alternative state. This suggests that strategies for sustainable management of such ecosystems should focus on maintaining resilience.},

However, the stakeholders' perception of ecosystem services from grasslands, a major agricultural land cover in (pre-)Alpine landscapes, has received only limited attention. Furthermore, studying the heterogeneity of perceptions within stakeholder groups is a major scientific need. In this study, we examined the perceptions of farmers and citizens regarding grassland ecosystem services, specifically the matches and mismatches between perceived suitability of grasslands and importance assigned by farmers in their management considerations. We conducted surveys in a study area in southern Bavaria, Germany, in 2018. Overall, ecosystem services that citizens perceived as very suitable to be provided by grasslands aligned well with the ecosystem services that are highly important to farmers in their management considerations, but significant mismatches also existed among all categories of ecosystem services. Clustering and dimension reduction revealed two clusters of farmers and three clusters of citizens depending on farm characteristics and environmental attitudes, respectively. Redundancy analysis showed a strong influence of the stakeholder cluster on the perception of the services assessed. Furthermore, age and gender influenced the perceptions attached to grassland ecosystem services.},

Not all environmental degradation is human-induced: natural processes such as floods and droughts can also reduce the earth's productivity, and non-human species also alter and transform ecosystems. However, we human beings are far more effective than other species in altering our environments in an effort to satisfy our needs, and our very success often makes us a danger to others and to ourselves. Unlike other species, moreover, we make conscious, contestable choices about how resources are used, who uses them, and how we understand ourselves in relation to nature.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Maoist China provides an example of extreme human interference in the natural world in an era in which human relationships were also unusually distorted. The period illustrates the relationship between political repression and environmental degradation, demonstrating the tragedy of this interface under extreme conditions. The environmental dynamics of the period suggest a congruence between violence among human beings and violence by humans toward the nonhuman world. When the Chinese people mistreated each other through suppression of intellectual freedoms, tyrannical utopianism, political labeling, ostracism, punishment, terror, and forcible relocations, they also treated nature badly.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The political dynamics of the Mao period as they affected nature are complex, however; they do not simply involve coercion of political victims from among the urban intellectual or Communist elite.{$<$}/p{$><$}/div{$>$}},

  abstract = {In recent decades, the streamflow and sediment of the Yellow River has decreased sharply, especially the sediment discharge. The factors that lead to this phenomenon have become a widely concerned problem of the whole society. The analysis of abrupt change points of hydrological series is the key to divide datum period, so it is an important work in the research of streamflow and sediment reduction cause. So far, many methods have been proposed to detect abrupt change. However, most methods have great uncertainty due to the deficiencies of irrational structure of test statistics, ideal hypothesis or subjectivity. In this paper, a new method called moving average difference method for abrupt change points detection is proposed. It is proved to be effective through comparison with four commonly used methods via both synthetic series and real data case study. The results show that the proposed method has four distinct advantages: (1) The test statistic structure of the method has physical significance and is intuitive to understand; (2) It is more accurate in abrupt change detection; (3) It can detect all of the abrupt change points at one time; (4) It can detect the abrupt changes and calculate the corresponding mutation intensity simultaneously.},

Analyses of nearly 65 years' data measured at 01_manuscript hydrologic-stations on the Yellow River from 1950 to 2014 indicated that, except for the Tangnaihai station in the head region, sharp downward trends existed in both the annual runoff and annual sediment load according to the Mann-Kendal trend test; and their abrupt changes occurred in 1986 and in 1980, respectively, according to the rank sum test. Factors affecting the changes in the runoff and sediment load were very complicated. Results indicated that the reducing precipitation and the increasing water consumption were the 01_manuscript causes for the runoff decline, while the impoundment of the Longyangxia Reservoir and its combined operation with the Liujiaxia Reservoir exerted a direct bearing on the abrupt change in the annual runoff. In addition to the sediment load decrease associated with the runoff reduction, the reduced storm intensity, the conducted soil erosion control, and the constructed dam buildings all played an important role in the trends and abrupt changes of sediment load decline.

To assess the influence of the Yellow River, 31 sites are selected from the wheat-maize double cropping system, and grouped into two: 10 sites near and 21 sites far from the river. Our data show that mean soil C: N ratio is low (7.6-9.9) across the region, and not affected by the Yellow River. However, SOC and TN are significantly (P {$<$} 0.05) lower in subsoil near the Yellow River (2.0 and 0.2-0.3 g kg(-1) for SOC and TN) than far away (3.1 and 0.4 g kg(-1)); delta C-13 is significantly more negative below 60 cm near the river (-23.3 to -22.6\%) than far away (-21.8 to -21.4\%). We estimate that the contributions of wheat and maize to SOC are 61.3-68.1\% and 31.9-38.8\%, respectively. Our analyses indicate that the overall low levels of SOC in the North China Plain may be associated with the low soil C: N ratio and less clay content. The hydrological processes may also partly be responsible, particularly for those near the Yellow River.},

  abstract = {Due to climate change and its aggravation by human activities (e.g. hydraulic structures) over the past several decades, the hydrological conditions in the middle Yellow River have markedly changed, leading to a sharp decrease in runoff and sediment discharge. This paper focused on the impacts of climate change and hydraulic structures on runoff and sediment discharge, and the study area was located in the 3246km(2) Huangfuchuan (HFC) River basin. Changes in annual runoff and sediment discharge were initially analysed by using the Mann-Kendall trend test and Pettitt change point test methods. Subsequently, periods of natural and disturbed states were defined. The results showed that both the annual runoff and sediment discharge presented statistically significant decreasing trends. However, compared with the less remarkable decline in annual rainfall, it was inferred that hydraulic structures might be another important cause for the sharp decrease in runoff and sediment discharge in this region. Consequently, sediment-trapping dams (STDs, a type of large-sized check dam used to prevent sediment from entering the Yellow River 01_manuscript stem) were considered in this study. Through evaluating the impacts of the variation in rainfall patterns (i.e. amount and intensity) and the STD construction, a positive correlation between rainfall intensity and current STD construction was found. This paper revealed that future soil and water conservation measures should focus on areas with higher average annual rainfall and more rainstorm hours. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

This paper simulated and analysed the impact of sediment-trapping dams (STDs, a type of large-sized check dam used to prevent sediment from entering the Yellow River 01_manuscript stem) on hydrological processes, and the study area was located in the 3246km(2) Huangfuchuan River basin. Changes in the hydrological processes were analysed, and periods of natural and disturbed states were defined. Subsequently, the number and distribution of the STDs were determined based on data collected from statistical reports and identified from remote sensing images, and the topological relationships between the STDs and high-resolution river reaches were established. A hydrological model, the digital Yellow River integrated model, was used to simulate the STD impact on the hydrological processes, and the maximum STD impact was evaluated through a comparison between the simulation results with and without the STDs, which revealed that the interception effect of the STDs contributed to the decrease of the streamflow by approximately 39\%. This paper also analysed the relationship between the spatial distribution of the STDs and rainfall in the Huangfuchuan River basin and revealed that future soil and water conservation measures should focus on areas with a higher average annual rainfall and higher number of rainstorm hours.

  abstract = {The base level is one of the key factors controlling river evolution. In the Yellow River mouth, a base-level rise takes place not only because of a relative sea-level rise, but also as a consequence of the increasing of river channel length associated with the large progradation rate of the delta. A change in river length results in a change in the gradient (slope) of the mouth channel, which further leads to a riverbed aggradation/degradation or a water level change at the deltaic apex. This process is principally associated with the morphodynamic backwater effect. The consequent water level change can be considered as a base-level change of the Yellow River. In this work, a relation was constructed between the water level at the deltaic apex and the riverine water and sediment inputs, as well as with the gradient of the mouth channel in the progradation period of each deltaic lobe. Also, for disclosing the importance of the base-level change due to variations of mouth channel length, it was estimated and compared with the relative sea-level change in the past decades, and for predicting the water level at the deltaic apex, the relation between mouth channel length and cumulative riverine sediment input was investigated. It was found that in the period 1953-2016, the base-level changes associated with variations of the mouth channel length could be larger than 1 m, or even larger than 2 m in one year, with a conservatively estimated annual mean of 34.8 mm/a, which is much larger than the relative sea-level change of 7.0 mm/a In the Yellow River mouth. The mouth channel length is closely and linearly related to the cumulative sediment discharge of the Yellow River. The relation for calculating the water level at the deltaic apex was found to be capable of giving a reliable result with the riverine water and sediment inputs, the relative sea-level, and the mouth channel length estimated from cumulative riverine sediment discharge. This relation was also used to estimate the equilibrium gradient of the mouth channel for sediment transport. The results show that after the year 2000, the equilibrium gradient has remained smaller than the actual gradient of the mouth channel, and both gradients decreased continuously with the decrease of riverine sediment inputs, but their values were becoming closer to each other. It is highly possible that the water level at the deltaic apex will be raised by the increase in sediment discharge of the river in the future.},

  abstract = {Diversion of the Yellow River is a unique geological event in offshore China, causing changes of the sedimentary environment in eastern China Seas. The last diversion took place in AD 1855, with the estuary diverted from the Yellow Sea into the Bohai Sea. The identification of the river diversion events in the shelf sediments would not only provide the definite ages for the sediments, but also give a clue for better understanding of the sedimentation in that area. In this study, Pb-210, grain size, geochemical element, and foraminiferal data in core H205 from the north Yellow Sea were systematically investigated. A high-resolution sedimentary record was established, which was coupled with the Yellow River diversion and runoff changes. The results show that the foraminiferal composition and foraminiferal abundance of the sediments from the north Yellow Sea had good response to the Yellow River diversion in 1855. Before the change, shallow water assemblages dominated the foraminifera, and the abundance of each foraminiferal species was very low. After the diversion event, the abundance of most foraminifera increased sharply, with a maximum increase of 16 times, and the assemblage was still dominated by shallow water species. Furthermore, the changes in foraminiferal abundance in the core sediments corresponded well with the discharge fluctuation of the Yellow River since 1855. When the Yellow River began entering the Bohai Sea, the Yellow River water, which is rich in nutrients, along with the coastal currents affected the north Yellow Sea, increased the primary productivity in the north Yellow Sea, which is the 01_manuscript reason for the abrupt increase and fluctuation of foraminiferal abundance in this area. At the meantime, the East Asian winter monsoon could also promote the development of nearshore foraminiferal species by enhancing the coastal currents.},

  abstract = {The standard assumptions that underlie many conceptual and quantitative frameworks do not hold for many complex physical, biological, and social systems. Complex systems science clarifies when and why such assumptions fail and provides alternative frameworks for understanding the properties of complex systems. This review introduces some of the basic principles of complex systems science, including complexity profiles, the tradeoff between efficiency and adaptability, the necessity of matching the complexity of systems to that of their environments, multiscale analysis, and evolutionary processes. Our focus is on the general properties of systems as opposed to the modeling of specific dynamics; rather than provide a comprehensive review, we pedagogically describe a conceptual and analytic approach for understanding and interacting with the complex systems of our world. This paper assumes only a high school mathematical and scientific background so that it may be accessible to academics in all fields, decision-makers in industry, government, and philanthropy, and anyone who is interested in systems and society.},

  abstract = {Drylands display specific vulnerability-creating mechanisms which threaten ecosystems and human well-being. The upscaling of successful interventions to reduce vulnerability arises as an important, but challenging aim, since drylands are not homogenous. To support this aim, we present the first attempt to categorise dryland vulnerability at a global scale and sub-national resolution. The categorisation yields typical patterns of dryland vulnerability and their policy implications according to similarities among the socio-ecological systems. Based on a compilation of prevalent vulnerability-creating mechanisms, we quantitatively indicate the most important dimensions including poverty, water stress, soil degradation, natural agro-constraints and isolation. A cluster analysis reveals a set of seven typical vulnerability patterns showing distinct indicator combinations. These results are validated by case studies reflecting the cluster-specific mechanisms and their spatial distribution. Based on these patterns, we deduce thematic and spatial entry points for reducing dryland vulnerability. Our findings could contribute new insights into allocating the limited funds available for dryland development and support related monitoring efforts based on the manageable number of key indicators.

  abstract = {The hydropower system in the Upper Yellow River (UYR), one of the largest hydropower bases in China, plays a vital role in the energy structure of the Qinghai Power Grid. Due to management difficulties, there is still considerable room for improvement in the joint operation of this system. This paper presents a general LINGO-based integrated framework to study the operation of the UYR hydropower system. The framework is easy to use for operators with little experience in mathematical modeling, takes full advantage of LINGO's capabilities (such as its solving capacity and multi-threading ability), and packs its three layers (the user layer, the coordination layer, and the base layer) together into an integrated solution that is robust and efficient and represents an effective tool for data/scenario management and analysis. The framework is general and can be easily transferred to other hydropower systems with minimal effort, and it can be extended as the base layer is enriched. The multi-objective model that represents the trade-off between power quantity (i.e., maximum energy production) and power reliability (i.e., firm output) of hydropower operation has been formulated. With equivalent transformations, the optimization problem can be solved by the nonlinear programming (NLP) solvers embedded in the LINGO software, such as the General Solver, the Multi-start Solver, and the Global Solver. Both simulation and optimization are performed to verify the model's accuracy and to evaluate the operation of the UYR hydropower system. A total of 13 hydropower plants currently in operation are involved, including two pivotal storage reservoirs on the Yellow River, which are the Longyangxia Reservoir and the Liujiaxia Reservoir. Historical hydrological data from multiple years (2000 +/- 2010) are provided as input to the model for analysis. The results are as follows. 1) Assuming that the reservoirs are all in operation (in fact, some reservoirs were not operational or did not collect all of the relevant data during the study period), the energy production is estimated as 267.7, 357.5, and 358.3x10(8) KWh for the Qinghai Power Grid during dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. 2) Assuming that the hydropower system is operated jointly, the firm output can reach 3110 MW(reliability of 100\%) and 3510MW (reliability of 90\%). Moreover, a decrease in energy production from the Longyangxia Reservoir can bring about a very large increase in firm output from the hydropower system. 3) The maximum energy production can reach 297.7, 363.9, and 411.4x10(8) KWh during dry, normal, and wet years, respectively. The trade-off curve between maximum energy production and firm output is also provided for reference.},

  abstract = {The book is the first of its kind to deal with almost the entire swath of water resources assessment, development and sustainable management. The idea of the book crystallized during the long journey of the Editors on various facets of water issues in India and abroad during their extended association, at all levels with the Ministry of Water Resources, River Development and Ganga Rejuvenation, as well as International Organizations dealing with water. Currently water-stressed, India is likely to become water scarce in not too distant a future. The global freshwater supply and its sustainable use for human consumption, and conservation of the ecosystem have never come under such a rigorous scrutiny before. The unplanned and reckless exploitation of this precious resource have led to a crisis situation, compounded by a real threat of climate change. This book is, therefore, timely and of particular relevance not only to India but the entire world. The book contains 20 chapters, beside the lead article by the Editors. The chapters are contributed by the eminent professionals, researchers, academicians and civil society representatives having an in-depth understanding of the issues. The contents of the chapters have been chosen to represent all aspects of water. The assessment of water resources using satellite data and in-depth analyses of groundwater sector like, the Aquifer Mapping Programme initiated by Government of India, application of gravity satellite data to assess the resource build up, artificial recharge of aquifers and its contamination, are dealt with by eminent experts. The articles on sustainable management of water through good governance by community participation and involvement of civil society are placed. Flood management both through a basin level approach as well as by building resilience in vulnerable areas is discussed. Other critical issues like water bodies management, constitutional provisions, water governance and financial issues, hydro-power and need of research and development in this sector are also dealt with aptly. In view of emerging crisis and complexities in this sector the future pathways and the paradigm shift that is required in administrative and policy level is also discussed.},

Specifically, we propose socio-hydrology as a use-inspired scientific discipline to focus on understanding, interpretation, and scenario development of the flows and stocks in the human-modified water cycle across time and space scales. A key aspect of socio-hydrology is explicit inclusion of two-way feedbacks between human and water systems, which differentiates socio-hydrology from other inter-disciplinary disciplines dealing with water. We illustrate the potential of socio-hydrology through three examples of water sustainability problems, defined as paradoxes, which can only be fully resolved within a new socio-hydrologic framework that encompasses such two-way coupling between human and water systems.},

Stemming from social ecological systems theories of climate change adaptation and adaptive capacity, this case study introduces the concept of `divergent' adaptation. Adaptation is divergent when one user or group's adaptation causes a subsequent reduction in another user or group's adaptive capacity in the same ecosystem. Using the example of pastoral and agricultural groups in northern and southern rainfall zones of Niger, this study illustrates the concept of divergent adaptation by identifying changes to the adaptive capacity of users who are currently engaged in conflicts over access to natural resources. Similar to other studies, we find that expansion of farmland and the consequent loss of pastoral space are restricting pastoral adaptation. Divergent adaptations favoring agricultural livelihoods include cultivating near or around pastoral wells or within pastoral corridors, both of which limit the mobility and entitlements of pastoralists. Institutions rarely secure pastoral routes and access to water points, a problem that is compounded by conflicting modes of governance, low accountability, and corruption. The case study illustrates the need to enhance the adaptive capacity of multiple user groups to reduce conflict, enhance human security, and promote overall resilience.},

  abstract = {Involving multiple stakeholders in conservation and natural resource management through participatory and collaborative approaches has been lauded as having great potential for achieving healthy and resilient social-ecological systems. Within these approaches, social learning has come to be understood as a key process that can support resilient systems by fostering trust and mutual understanding between stakeholders, bringing diverse types of knowledge into management schemes, and increasing the adaptive capacity of social-ecological systems so they are better equipped to accommodate change and disturbance. Yet, research on social learning with respect to conservation and natural resource management has thus far failed to consequentially attend to the intensive research and theoretical perspectives on learning from the learning sciences and educational research more broadly, perspectives that we argue can offer new insights to the social learning scholarship. Specifically, we synthesize and assess the value of sociocultural theories of learning to improve research on social learning processes and outcomes in the context of social-ecological resilience. Sociocultural learning theories help explain learning at both the individual and collective level, as well as the role of social, cultural, and historical contexts as constitutive components of learning. We argue that future studies of social learning should consider engaging with these theories to yield more rich and nuanced insights for the conservation and natural resource management fields with the goal of bolstering social-ecological resilience.},

  abstract = {This study investigated the dissolved trace metal contamination levels of Zn, Sr, B, Al, Ba, Fe, Mn, Li, V, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mo, Ni, Se, and Pb in 23 surface waters of the Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China. Coefficients of variation with 66-260\% reflected large spatial variations of concentrations of metals. Compared to drinking water guidelines established by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the primary trace metal pollution components (Al, B, V, and Zn) were above drinking water standard levels by 82.6\%, 47.8\%, 52.2\%, and 52.2\%, respectively. Preliminary risk assessments were determined via the Hazard Quotient (HQ) to evaluate the human health risk of these metals. HQ(ingestion) of V indicated potential deleterious health effects for residents. Hierarchical cluster results revealed that clusters 1, 2, and 3 were primarily affected by pollution from industrial and domestic activities, natural and agriculture activities, and oil fields, respectively. Principal component analysis results indicated Fe, Mn, Al, and Ba were controlled by natural sources, whereas anthropogenic activities led to high pollution levels of Al, B, V, Zn, and Sr.},

  abstract = {Collective memory plays a controlling role in adaptation to potential flood risks, by learning from past disasters. However, with little quantitative empirical data, previous socio-hydrological models have conceptualized the decaying process of flood memory in an oversimple approach. Here, based on survey data of 683 respondents on Ningxia Floodplain, we confirmed that flood memory decays overtime via two channels: oral communication (communicative memory) and physical recording of information (cultural memory). Using the Universal Decay Model (UDM) proposed by previous researchers provides better fitting of results to the decay of flooding memory (adjusted R2 coefficient are 0.97, 0.90, 0.95 when data of all, rural or urban respondents used, respectively) compared with the original exponential model (adjusted R2 coefficient are 0.91, 0.74, 0.59, corresponding). Then, significantly reduced losses for the same flood sequence predicted by integrating the UDM into a sociohydrological model by 16\% and the differences between different clusters (urban and rural respondents) can even reach 22.81\%. These differences suggest that previous socio-hydrological models have been too simplistic in their conceptualizations of decaying processes associated with collective memory, which may have limited deeper insights into flood risk management.},

The responses of Spinifex littoreus to different sand burial depths and levels were examined on the coast of Pingtan Island, Fujian Province, South China. The results indicated that, compared with the control group (CG), sand burial on the S. littoreus stolons had no significant impact on the vertical growth of its conjoint ramets. However, the horizontal growth of S. littoreus stolons was stimulated and significantly increased in half-intense (HI) and complete-intense (CI) sand burial treatments by 24.56\% and 40.79\%, respectively. Throughout the experiment, about 96\% of adventitious roots were observed on the base section of stolons, while no roots in the control group (CG). After 20-day artificial sand burial treatments, the dry weight ratio between stem and leaf of S. littoreus was decreased in all three sections of stolons, especially for the top sections. Overall, S. littoreus can adapt to the complete and intense sand burial in growing season by rapid growth of stolons, abundant production of adventitious roots on the stolon base, and more germination of leaves on the stolon top.},

In river basins, changes in sediment transport can have cascading effects that cause ecosystem regime shifts. The Yellow River, once the world's most sediment-rich river, has experienced dramatic regime shifts. Although recent intervention has returned sediment discharge in the Yellow River to pristine levels, our understanding of previous regime shifts remains inadequate, particularly for the regime shift to a sediment rich period during early historical time. We reanalyzed previous datasets to clarify the first historical sediment transport regime shift in the Yellow River. Our results show that while historical climatic changes (e.g., the Medieval Warm Period, about 900-1100 AD) caused changes in sediment transport, a regime shift occurred only under increased forcing from anthropogenic stresses (started from about 1350 AD, reached the tipping point after 1900 AD). This unique behavior of the Yellow River under increasing anthropogenic forces may provide perspective for sustainable river basin management.},

  abstract = {Hydraulic geometry relations comprise a classic way to understand characteristics of a river. However, environmental changes pose large uncertainties for the reliability of such relations. In the current study, on the basis of the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) formed through linear treatment of the deterministic power-law hydraulic geometry relations, a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by Fractional white noise and Poisson noise are developed to simulate the historical dynamic probability distributions of typical hydraulic geometry variables such as slope, width, depth, and velocity with bankfull discharge variation over time in the lower Yellow River of China. One group of possible stochastic average behaviors within the next 50 years are calculated under three different design incoming water-sediment conditions (including 300, 600, and 800 million t of annual average sediment discharge). In each part of the lower reaches, after estimation of the SDE parameters using a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method, the model is carefully examined using Monte Carlo simulation as compared with the deterministic control models. The results of this comparison reveal the potential responses of hydraulic geometry characteristics to environmental disturbances, and the average trends mainly agree with the measurements. Comparisons among the three different prediction results reveal the stochastic average solution generally is greater than the deterministic solution. The results also confirm the severe negative impacts that result from the condition of 300 million t of incoming sediment, thus, pointing out the need to raise the level of river evolution alert for the lower Yellow River of China in the future. Moreover, with the help of the stochastic computation, the stream power and hydraulic width/depth ratio could be representative of an effective systematic measure for river dynamics. The proposed stochastic approach is not only important to development in the field of fluvial relations, but also beneficial to the practical design and monitoring of a river system according to specified accuracy requirements.

These are increasingly being critiqued because (1) there is an absence of feedbacks between water and society; (2) the models are created by domain experts who hand them to decision makers to implement; and (3) they fail to account for global forces on local water resources. Socio-hydrological models that explicitly account for feedbacks between water and society at multiple scales and facilitate stakeholder participation can address these concerns. However, they require a fundamental change in how we think about prediction. We suggest that, in the context of long-range predictions, the goal is not scenarios that present a snapshot of the world at some future date, but rather projection of alternative, plausible and co-evolving trajectories of the socio-hydrological system. This will both yield insights into cause\textendash effect relationships and help stakeholders identify safe or desirable operating space.},

These analyses revealed that many individuals were concerned about the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to climate change; however, many were also armed with justifications excusing their and others' inaction on the problem. To establish further how the ideas shared in the interviews related to social dominance, we reworked the ideas into statements for surveybased research in Study Two. Social dominance orientation and its composite dimensions related to most interview-based statements, with those scoring higher on dominance attitudes more opposed to top-down action on climate change, and those more tolerant of inequality more opposed to individual action.

Crossing the threshold would lead to a much higher global average temperature than any interglacial in the past 1.2 million years and to sea levels significantly higher than at any time in the Holocene. We examine the evidence that such a threshold might exist and where it might be. If the threshold is crossed, the resulting trajectory would likely cause serious disruptions to ecosystems, society, and economies. Collective human action is required to steer the Earth System away from a potential threshold and stabilize it in a habitable interglacial-like state. Such action entails stewardship of the entire Earth System-biosphere, climate, and societies-and could include decarbonization of the global economy, enhancement of biosphere carbon sinks, behavioral changes, technological innovations, new governance arrangements, and transformed social values.},

  abstract = {As global environmental change continues to accelerate and intensify, science and society are turning to trans\- disciplinary approaches to facilitate transitions to sustainability. Modeling is increasingly used as a technological tool to improve our understanding of social-ecological systems (SES), encourage collaboration and learning, and facilitate decision-making. This study improves our understanding of how SES models are designed and applied to address the rising challenges of global environmental change, using mountains as a representative system. We analyzed 74 peer-reviewed papers describing dynamic models of mountain SES, evaluating them according to characteristics such as the model purpose, data and model type, level of stakeholder involvement, and spatial extent/resolution. Slightly more than half the models in our analysis were participatory, yet only 21.6\% of papers demonstrated any direct outreach to decision makers. We found that SES models tend to under-represent social datasets, with ethnographic data rarely incorporated. Modeling efforts in conditions of higher stakeholder diversity tend to have higher rates of decision support compared to situations where stakeholder diversity is absent or not addressed. We discuss our results through the lens of appropriate technology, drawing on the concepts of boundary objects and scalar devices from Science and Technology Studies. We propose four guiding principles to facilitate the development of SES models as appropriate technology for transdisciplinary applications: (1) increase diversity of stakeholders in SES model design and application for improved collaboration; (2) balance power dynamics among stakeholders by incorporating diverse knowledge and data types; (3) promote flexibility in model design; and (4) bridge gaps in decision support, learning, and communication. Creating SES models that are appropriate tech\- nology for transdisciplinary applications will require advanced planning, increased funding for and attention to the role of diverse data and knowledge, and stronger partnerships across disciplinary divides. Highly contextualized participatory modeling that embraces diversity in both data and actors appears poised to make strong contributions to the world's most pressing environmental challenges.},

  abstract = {A systematic characterization of multivariate dependence at multiple spatio-temporal scales is critical to understanding climate system dynamics and improving predictive ability from models and data. However, dependence structures in climate are complex due to nonlinear dynamical generating processes, long-range spatial and long-memory temporal relationships, as well as low-frequency variability. Here we utilize complex networks to explore dependence in climate data. Specifically, networks constructed from reanalysis-based atmospheric variables over oceans and partitioned with community detection methods demonstrate the potential to capture regional and global dependence structures within and among climate variables. Proximity-based dependence as well as long-range spatial relationships are examined along with their evolution over time, yielding new insights on ocean meteorology. The tools are implicitly validated by confirming conceptual understanding about aggregate correlations and teleconnections. Our results also suggest a close similarity of observed dependence patterns in relative humidity and horizontal wind speed over oceans. In addition, updraft velocity, which relates to convective activity over the oceans, exhibits short spatiotemporal decorrelation scales but long-range dependence over time. The multivariate and multi-scale dependence patterns broadly persist over multiple time windows. Our findings motivate further investigations of dependence structures among observations, reanalysis and model-simulated data to enhance process understanding, assess model reliability and improve regional climate predictions.},

Individuals may behave differently in different domains, but success in one domain may engender success in another. Here, we study this problem using multilayer networks to model multiple domains of social interactions, in which individuals experience different environments and may express different behaviours. We provide a mathematical analysis and find that coupling between layers tends to promote prosocial behaviour. Even if prosociality is disfavoured in each layer alone, multilayer coupling can promote its proliferation in all layers simultaneously. We apply this analysis to six real-world multilayer networks, ranging from the socio-emotional and professional relationships in a Zambian community, to the online and offline relationships within an academic university. We discuss the implications of our results, which suggest that small modifications to interactions in one domain may catalyse prosociality in a different domain.},

Taking the 213-km-long Linhe reach braided channel of the Yellow River as an example, area changes in channel bank erosion/accretion in four sub-reaches (S1, S2, S3 and S4) over 19 different periods were evaluated on the basis of remote sensing images captured since 1977. Mean channel shrinkage rate for the whole river reach was also obtained. Results show that the left and right banks of the Linhe reach were dominated by lateral net accretion between 1977 and 2014. The channel area of this section of the Yellow River was characterized by reduction between 1977 and 2001, while periods of alternate erosion and accretion occurred subsequent to 2001. Mean channel shrinkage rate in the Linhe reach braided channel was 6.15 km(2)/yr between 1977 and 2014, while the most remarkable changes in channel planform occurred in the 1990s. Compared to 1995, channel length and sinuosity increased by 5.8\% and 6.6\% by 2000, while channel area and mean width decreased by 39.4\% and 42.8\%, respectively. Significant changes in channel planform and shrinkage of the Linhe reach occurred in the 1990s, mainly as a result of the joint-operation of the Longyangxia and Liujiaxia reservoirs since 1986, which caused substantial reductions in runoff and sediment flux during the annual flooding season. In addition, bank erosion/accretion in the four sub-reaches was affected by the physical properties of local banks, engineering emplaced to protect channel banks, and hydrodynamic differences. However, since the implementation of integrated river management measures from 2000 onwards, these changes have been significantly mitigated and the health of the Linhe reach braided channel of the Yellow River has been restored.},

  abstract = {The Chinese Loess Plateau is the most seriously eroded area in the world and contributes the vast majority of the sediment that goes into the Yellow River. Since the 1950s, progressive soil and water conservation measures have been implemented-in particular, large-scale ecological restoration has been ongoing since 1999-resulting in a significant reduction of the sediment load. However, the mechanism of the sediment transport dynamics is not fully understood due to multiple and complicated influencing factors including climate change and human activities (e.g., ecological restoration). A challenging question, then, arises: Is the current low sediment level a "new normal" in this era and in the future? To address this question, we selected a typical loess hilly region where considerable ecological restoration has been implemented, and which is regarded as the site of the first and most representative Grain-for-Green program in the Loess Plateau. We investigated the evolution of discharge-sediment relationships in the past decades (1960-2010) and their association with the soil and water conservation measures in this area. The results showed that there was a distinct change in the regression parameters of the commonly used annual discharge-sediment regression equation-a continuously increasing trend of parameter b and a decreasing trend of parameter a, accompanying the ecological restoration. The increase in exponent b (i.e., a steeper slope) implies a potential lower sediment load resulting from low discharge and a potential higher sediment load resulting from large discharge. This finding may question the new normal of a low sediment level and implies the potential risk of a large sediment load during extremely wet years. (C) 2019 THE AUTHORS.

Due to climate change, extremely high temperature accompanied with drought (expressed as hot drought) may lead to intensive losses of both properties and human deaths in future. A hot drought probabilistic recognition system is developed to investigate how potential future climate changes will impact the simultaneous occurrence of drought and hot extremes (hot days exceeding certain values) on the LP. Two regional climate models, coupled with multiple bias-correction techniques and multivariate probabilistic inference, are innovative integrated into the hot drought probabilistic recognition system to reveal the concurrence risk of droughts and hot extremes under different Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios. The hot-day index, TX90p, indicating the number of days with daily maximum temperature (T-max) exceeding the 90th percentile threshold, and the Standardized Precipitation Index are applied to identify the joint risks on the LP using copula-based methods. The results show that precipitation will increase throughout most of the LP under both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios of 2036-2095, while T-max may increase significantly all over the LP (1.8-2.7 degrees C for RCP4.5 and 2.7-3.6 degrees C for RCP8.5). The joint return periods of Standardized Precipitation Index and TX90p show that fewer stations will experience severe drought with long-term hot extremes in two future scenarios. However, some stations may experience hot droughts that are more frequent and extreme, particularly certain stations in the southwest and south-central regions of the LP with recurrence period less than 10 years.},

However, few studies have been conducted to quantify the effects of incorporated plant litter on the soil detachment process by overland flow. This study was performed to investigate the effects of incorporated litter rate on soil detachment capacity and soil resistance to flowing water erosion using undisturbed soil samples taken from 16 plots (three plant litter species by five incorporation rates, and one bare control) and were subjected to six different flow shear stresses in the Loess Plateau. The results showed that soil detachment capacity decreased exponentially with incorporated plant litter rate. A threshold of 0.35 kg m(-2) of litter needed to be incorporated to provide protection of soil from overland flow erosion. The effects of litter incorporation rate on soil detachment capacity was not significant when the incorporation rate was greater than 0.35 kg m(-2). Rill erodibility also decreased exponentially with the incorporated plant litter rate. The shape of plant litter fragments was hypothesised to account for the variations in the effects of different incorporated litter species on soil detachment capacity and rill erodibility. A distinguishable increasing linear trend was observed between critical shear stress and litter incorporated rate, but with a weak correlation. Critical shear stress also increased with incorporated rate and was related to soil cohesion. (C) 2016 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, whether climate warming will amplify or diminish the impact of extreme flooding on wetland ecosystems is unknown. Here, we show that climate warming significantly reduced wetland resistance and resilience to a severe flooding event via a 6-year warming experiment. We first found that warming rapidly altered plant community structure by increasing the dominance of low-canopy species. Then, we showed that warming reduced the resistance and resilience of vegetation productivity to a 72-cm flooding event. Last, we detected slower postflooding carbon processes, such as gross ecosystem productivity, soil respiration, and soil methane emission, under the warming treatment. Our results demonstrate how severe flooding can destabilize wetland vegetation structure and ecosystem function under climate warming. These findings indicate an enhanced footprint of extreme hydrological events in wetland ecosystems in a warmer climate.           ,              Climate warming enhances the vulnerability of a wetland to extreme flooding via shifting vegetation structure.},

Four soils were collected from north to south of the Loess Plateau, namely Sandy Loess (SL), Loessial Soil (LS), Heilu Soil (HS) and Anthrosol Soil (AS), to examine the impacts of soil property on mean flow velocity in both interrill and rill flows under different simulated rainfall experiments. The mean velocity of interrill flow (MVIF) followed the order of LS {$>$} HS approximate to AS {$>$} SL at 90 mm h(-1) rainfall intensity and LS {$>$} HS {$>$} AS {$>$} SL at 120 mm h(-1) rainfall intensity. The mean velocity of rill flow (MVRF) decreased as LS approximate to HS {$>$} AS at 90 mm h(-1) and LS approximate to HS {$>$} AS {$>$} SL at 120 mm h(-1). The order of MVIF and MVRF on four soil slopes is determined by the relations of runoff discharge, Darcy-Weisbach friction factor in interrill area (f(1)) and rills (f(R)), which are closely related to soil properties. Soil properties also changed the effects of rainfall intensity on flow velocities in different erosion stages, resulting in the increasing trend of MVIF on SL, HS and AS slopes and the decreasing trend of MVIF on LS slope with the increase of rainfall intensity. Moreover, soil properties may change the variations of MVIF and MVRF with the increase of slope gradient, by altering the relations of sealing progress and slope effect. The slope effect determined the increasing trend of MVIF with the increase of slope gradients. However, the sealing progress may offset the slope effect and cause the decrease of MVIF on the critical slopes, and the critical slope decreased from the north (20 degrees and 25 degrees) to the south (15 degrees). The equal roles of rill bed roughness and slope effect caused the unchanged of MVRF on LS and HS slopes, while rill bed roughness dominated the fluctuations of MVRF on SL and AS slopes.},

  abstract = {The concept of virtual water was first proposed by the geographer Tony Allan in 1993, referring to the amount of water needed to produce products and services. Research on virtual water has gradually increased in recent years. This paper explored the current research status of virtual water from the aspects of virtual water accounting methods, impact assessment, and research limitations and gaps. In terms of research methods, in addition to continuing to use traditional virtual water accounting methods, recent research also focuses on the use of input-output model to calculate virtual water content, the scenario analysis methods to predict future virtual water flow trends, and the gravitational model to analyze driving factors. The research content has also gradually diversified, from quantifying the virtual water content of commodities and analyzing virtual water flow paths, it has gradually evolved into ``temporal and spatial evolution of virtual water trade, research combined with water footprint, virtual water and economic development, virtual water impact assessment, analysis of virtual water flow driving force'' and other research content. The prediction and driving factors analysis of virtual water need further research; the availability and accuracy of data must be ensured. So virtual water research still needs to be improved and perfected. Virtual water research is an interdisciplinary discipline involving hydrology, socio-economy, and the ecological environment, so future research should be conducted in conjunction with relevant knowledge in other disciplines. And researching the impacts of virtual water trade on the formulation of regional trade policies and the regional ecological environment will provide a powerful reference for policy makers on the adjustment of regional trade patterns and management of water resources.

Though we have knowledge that human activities are greatly affecting land surface ecosystem processes and functions, the relationships between sediment transport regime and the intensifying human activities, are still poorly understood. This study was to investigate the changes of sediment transport regime due to the large-scale ecological restoration in the Middle Yellow River Basin (MYRB). In this study, we examined the change of the sediment rating curves using daily sediment load and streamfiow data from 30 stations during time periods including pre- and post-ecological restoration in this region. We found the pair-relationship of the rating parameters (coefficient and exponent), denoted as coefficient-exponent pair-line, is a critical indicator that can detect the shift of sediment transport regime due to disturbed land surface conditions, though the changed hydrometeorological condition may just influence the absolute values of the rating parameters. Our analysis indicates there was a significant and interesting change of the sediment transport regime in the MYRB characterized by the consistent shift of the coefficient-exponent pair-line, together with an increasing exponent and a decreasing coefficient.This changed sediment transport regime can tell that sediment delivery would become lower for normal discharge conditions but potentially higher for extreme discharge conditions, and this phenomenon seems more distinct in relatively smaller watersheds, suggesting a higher risk of the potential high sediment delivery for extreme rainfall conditions especially for small watersheds. Our study would be informative and valuable to decision makers for sustainable watershed management in the MYRB when considering the changed sediment delivery. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

A full-scale and scientific assessment in extreme precipitation characteristics is necessary for water resources management and providing decision-making support to mitigate the potential losses brought by extreme precipitation. In the present study, a multidimensional risk assessment framework is developed to investigate the spatial temporal changes in different extreme precipitation indicators. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to fit the distribution for each indicator and carry out single index risk assessment. The joint probabilistic features of multiple extreme indicators can be explored through coupling the GMM distributions into copulas. In addition, the moving window approach and the Mann Kendall test are integrated to examine non -stationary risks (evaluated by "AND", "OR", and Kendall return periods) of multidimensional indicators along with their changing trends and significance. The proposed assessment framework is applied to the Loess Plateau, China. Four extreme precipitation indicators are characterized: the amount (P95), the number of days (D95), the intensity (195), and the proportion (R95) of extreme precipitation. The spatial temporal changes of these indicators and their multidimensional combinations (including six two-dimensional and three three-dimensional combinations) are fully identified and quantitatively evaluated.},

Soil water exhibits a stochastic nature because of the large temporal variations in precipitation and evapotranspiration. Objectives of this study were to analyse the probabilistic nature of soil water under three vegetation types, to simulate their probability density functions (PDFs) using a stochastic model, and to determine the most sustainable vegetation types. Soil water data were collected over a 3-year period with a bi-weekly frequency at plots in the Loess Plateau, China, under grass (Bothriochloa ischaemum L., BOI), shrub, sea-buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L., SEB) and tree, Chinese pine (Pinus tabulaeformis Carr, CHP). The data were compared with values simulated using the Laio stochastic model. The results showed that the mean relative soil water contents differed in the order: BOI {$>$} CHP {$>$} SEB. Soil water was related to the daily rainfall and evapotranspiration. Under the same climate, topography and soil conditions, the soil water PDF was sensitive to a critical water content at which plants begin closing stomata and the mean maximum daily evapotranspiration rate. Based on the shape of the PDFs and their statistical moments, the Laio stochastic model accurately simulated the soil water PDFs under all three vegetation types in the semi-humid area of the Loess Plateau. The soil water PDFs for three vegetation types were simulated with four leaf area index scenarios; BOI and CHP were the most sustainable vegetation types compared with SEB in terms of maintaining soil water availability and soil erosion control.},

  abstract = {Over 30 y ago, Elinor Ostrom published Governing the Commons (1), a demonstration by counterexample that the successful management of common pool resources requires neither individual private property rights nor central government control. Her contribution and subsequent research identify more than a dozen institutional features, or "design principles," purported to make successful community-based, common pool resource management more likely (2, 3). Examples of these features include clearly defined group and resource boundaries, graduated sanctions, conflict-resolution mechanisms, enabling policy environments, and accountable monitoring systems. But after decades of theoretical and empirical studies, little is known about whether external interventions can enhance these features where they are weak or absent, or whether enhancing these features individually\textemdash rather than collectively\textemdash causes resource conditions to improve (4). These questions have long been identified as important for advancing sustainability science and practice (5). In this Special Feature on "Sustaining the Commons," the authors try to answer these questions by developing and testing mechanism-based theories of institutions in complex socio-ecological systems. The Special Feature makes three contributions to advancing sustainability science. It offers an exemplar of multiteam, harmonized research to accelerate the accumulation of generalizable knowledge in sustainability science. In addition, it sheds light on the causal relationship between community monitoring and common pool resource outcomes, a relationship that has long been of interest in the sustainability science literature (1, 6, 7). Finally, it offers a theoretically informed approach to guide synthesis of research findings from diverse contexts. Through these contributions, the Special Feature aims to stimulate discussion and debate among different communities of scholarship and practice in sustainability science. These communities include researchers and practitioners interested in common pool resource governance, adaptive management, comanagement and decentralization, citizen science, and democratic accountability, as well as those interested in applying new approaches for empirical research \ldots{}  [{$\carriagereturn$}][1]1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

As a result, countries and sectors exert pressure on natural resources both within and beyond their national borders. Where this resource demand is imposed matters to the effective management of global resource insecurity. Although instructive, the `resource footprint' of a country or sector \textendash{} a common yardstick to assess the sustainability of consumption \textendash{} does not distinguish its origin of production and associated resource risk. As a result, the source and severity of global resource insecurity remains poorly understood. To understand how resource use connects different actors within the global economy, the water, energy and land footprints of 189 countries and 14838 country sectors are analysed by source (domestic, macro-regional and remote) and risk (high, medium and low). Linking national consumption to source reveals countries and sectors are highly exposed, directly (via domestic production) and indirectly (via imports), to over-exploited, insecure, and degraded water, energy, and land resources. However, countries and sectors exhibit greater exposure to resource risks via international trade ({$\approx$}80\textendash 90\%), mainly from remote production sources. Within this context, countries and sectors share the same sources of resource supply and risk, highlighting an opportunity to manage their resource security by intervening in upstream global supply chains. Nevertheless, our findings also invite critical reflection on whether globali\- sation is compatible with managing risks countries face and drive across the global water-energy-land system.},

We aimed to assess and quantify the magnitude of soil erosion and its subsequent influence on hillslope with different land use pattern under an extreme rainstorm. Methods: We studied an extreme rainstorm on July 26, 2017 in Zizhou county on the Loess Plateau, China. 218 mm rain fell within 15 h with a maximum intensity of 52 mm h(-1) for 1 h. In rainstorm core, we investigated soil erosion characteristics on six hillslopes with different land use patterns which composed of sloping farmland (SF), grassland (GL), woodland (WL) and pasture (PA) on different slope positions. Three soil erosion types (rill, slope failure and gully incision) along the six hillslopes were measured in each land, respectively. The stream power was calculated to quantify the erosion effectiveness of rainstorm. The subsequent alteration of serious gully and slope failure were measured after two years. Results: The soil erosion intensities of hillslopes were in range of 6.94 x 10(3) -95.89 x 10(3) t km(-2). Soil erosion intensities on hillslopes with sloping farmland were several decuples larger than that on the hillslopes with woodland and grassland. Gully incision and slope failure supplied the most sediment of hillslope while rill erosion cannot be ignored only in sloping farmland. The scarce vegetation cover, the concave surface, side slope with large height, unreasonable drainage ditch and weeding were the 01_manuscript reasons for the serious erosion under this storm event. The gully incision thresholds of stream power were about 175 W m(-2), 370 W m(-2), less than 35 W m(-2 )and more than 460 W m(-2) for PA, GL, SF and WL, respectively. Almost all the sediment of gully transported from hillslope into downslope channel. The risk of gully incision increase 5 fold and decrease to 14 \% in fallow farmland and farmland under cultivation after rainstorm. Conclusions: Woodland and grassland with high vegetation coverage stood the erosion test of this extreme rainstorm due to high anti-erosion ability instead of runoff reduction and sediment interception. Reasonable agricultural management, such as avoiding weeding before extreme rainstorm and filling gully after erosion reduced decuples of erosion risk. Natural recovery of slope surface is not expected in these fragmentized slopes during a short period.},

We examine black carbon and charcoal influx, combined with the Magnetic susceptibility, delta C-13 values of soil organic matter, pollen counts and other paleo-environmental proxies to discuss interactions with biomass-climate during the Holocene. The history of fires from the charcoal and black carbon (BC, char and soot) influx at the two sites demonstrates a transition from climate-controlled low amplitude variations with peaks during the Early and Middle Holocene (11-3.1kyearsB.P.) to higher amplitude variability in fire occurrence decoupled from climate and tied to human activities during the Late Holocene (3.1-0kyearsB.P.). The difference in fire patterns was attributed to regional effective moisture and human land use over the entre Loess Plateau; meanwhile, fire activities observed during the Holocene are consistent with variations in vegetation composition inferred from delta C-13 values in soil organic matter, pollen counts, and paleoclimate proxies. Regional wildfires rarely occurred on the desert steppe dominated by a weedy C-3 taxon (Artemisia, Compositae, and Chenopodiaceae dominated)during the late glacial period. A limited biomass would not meet fire propagation in the extreme colder and drier environment of the Loess Plateau during those periods, though. As the climate became ameliorated during the early Holocene, there was an increasing biomass and a sufficient contribution do to high fuel accumulation from C-4 taxon (Gramineae). As the middle Holocene progressed toward warmer and wetter conditions, fire events were less frequent on the steppe and forest-steppe (e.g. expansion of trees C-3,C- Quercus, Corylus) of the Loess Plateau. Subsequently, the number of local and regional fire events have largely increased with the colder and drier climate conditions (e.g. expansion of C-3 weedy), which have been decoupling with intensive anthropogenic burning for farming since the past 3kyr. These data suggests that the regional fire patterns vary strongly along environmental gradients in the effective moisture and regional fuel availability as well as the spatial and temporal distributions of Neolithic burning practices over the Loess Plateau in response to the weakening East Asian monsoon during the Holocene.},

In some treatments, we give players the option to communicate intended contributions. We find that inequality reduces the prospects of reaching the target but that communication increases success dramatically. Successful groups tend to eliminate inequality over the course of the game, with rich players signaling willingness to redistribute early on. Our results suggest that coordination-promoting institutions and early redistribution from richer to poorer nations are both decisive for the avoidance of global calamities, such as disruptive climate change.},

  abstract = {Deforestation affects local and regional hydroclimate through changes in heating and moistening of the atmosphere. In the tropics, deforestation leads to warming, but its impact on rainfall is more complex, as it depends on spatial scale and synoptic forcing. Most studies have focused on Amazonia, highlighting that forest edges locally enhance convective rainfall, whereas rainfall decreases over drier, more extensive, deforested regions. Here, we examine Southern West Africa (SWA), an example of ``late-stage'' deforestation, ongoing since 1900 within a 300-km coastal belt. From three decades of satellite data, we demonstrate that the upward trend in convective activity is strongly modulated by deforestation patterns. The frequency of afternoon storms is enhanced over and downstream of deforested patches on length scales from 16 to 196 km, with greater increases for larger patches. The results are consistent with the triggering of storms by mesoscale circulations due to landscape heterogeneity. Near the coast, where sea breeze convection dominates the diurnal cycle, storm frequency has doubled in deforested areas, attributable to enhanced land\textendash sea thermal contrast. These areas include fast-growing cities such as Freetown and Monrovia, where enhanced storm frequency coincides with high vulnerability to flash flooding. The proximity of the ocean likely explains why ongoing deforestation across SWA continues to increase storminess, as it favors the impact of mesoscale dynamics over moisture availability. The coastal location of deforestation in SWA is typical of many tropical deforestation hotspots, and the processes highlighted here are likely to be of wider global relevance.},

Proposed drivers of regime shifts include changes in grazing, spatial clustering, and ocean temperature. Here we distill the dynamic regimes of coral-macroalgal interaction into a three-dimensional geometry, akin to thermodynamic phase diagrams of state transitions, to facilitate analysis. Specific regime-shifting forces can be understood as bifurcation vectors through the cubic regime geometry. This geometric perspective allows us to understand multiple forces simultaneously in terms of the stability and persistence of interacting species. For example, in a coral-macroalgae community, grazing on macroalgae can lead to alternative stable states when there is no spatial clustering (e.g., high habitat connectivity). However, with spatial clustering, grazing can lead to coexistence because of elevated local intraspecific competition. The geometrical analysis of regime shifts is applicable to any two-species communities and can help conservation efforts navigate complexity and abrupt changes.},

The key is using initial conditions to choose among a finite number of expected outcomes using a nonstandard finite mixture methodology. We apply the framework to contemporary issues in social-ecological systems, coral ecosystems, and chaotic systems, showing that incorporating history allows us to statistically infer process models with alternative stable states while minimizing false positives. Further, in the presence of disturbances and oscillations, alternative stable states can help rather than hamper inference. The ability to infer models with alternative stable states across natural systems can help accelerate scientific discoveries, change how we manage ecosystems and societies, and place modern theories on firmer empirical ground.},

Most explanations focus on institutional or ecological differences among resources. Here, we provide theoretical and empirical evidence that conservation and overharvest can be alternative stable states within the same exclusive-resource management system because of path-dependent processes, including slow institutional adaptation. Surprisingly, this theory predicts that the alternative states of strong conservation or overharvest are most likely for resources that were previously thought to be easily conserved under optimal management or even open access. Quantitative analyses of harvest rates from 217 intensely managed fisheries supports the predictions. Fisheries' harvest rates also showed transient dynamics characteristic of path dependence, as well as convergence to the alternative stable state after unexpected transitions. This statistical evidence for path dependence differs from previous empirical support that was based largely on case studies, experiments, and distributional analyses. Alternative stable states in conservation appear likely outcomes for many cooperatively managed renewable resources, which implies that achieving conservation outcomes hinges on harnessing existing policy tools to navigate transitions.},

In this study, we examined the trends, breaking point and regime changes for the runoff and sediment load at different temporal scales using 50years of continuous observational data from a highly erodible sub-catchment with an area of 7,325km(2) in the Beiluo River basin on the Loess Plateau, China. At the annual scale, the runoff and sediment load declined significantly (p{$<$}005) with decreasing rates of -023mmy(-1) and -1649Mgkm(-2)y(-1), respectively. Abrupt changes in the runoff and sediment load series were detected between 1979 and 1999; thus, the data were divided into intervals of 1960-1979, 1980-1999 and 2000-2009. The flow duration curve analysis indicated increasing low-flow values and decreasing daily runoff and sediment discharge peaks, which suggested that soil and water conservation measures reduced the volume of runoff and the sediment load. This led to a more uniform runoff regime. At the flood event scale, we investigated the relationship between runoff and the suspended sediment load based on 123 flood events, which showed clearly that the magnitude and frequency of hyper-concentrated sediment flows decreased in 2000-2009 compared with 1960-1999. The annual erosive rainfall exhibited non-significant changes throughout the entire study period. We conclude that soil and water conservation measures (e.g. afforestation, grassing, terraces and check dams) have played major roles in the changes in runoff and the sediment load in the Beiluo River catchment.

This study provides insight into China's water footprint and virtual water trade using three specific water named Green, Blue and Grey. A multi-region input-output analysis at national and sectoral analysis levels from the years 1995 to 2009 is conducted. The evolution and position of China's virtual water trade across a global supply chain are explored through cluster analysis. The results show that China represented 11.2\% of the global water footprint in 1995 and 13.6\% in 2009. The green virtual water is the largest of China's exports and imports. In general, China is a net exporter of virtual water during this time period. China mainly imports virtual water from the USA, India and Brazil, and mainly exports virtual water to the USA, Japan and Germany. The agriculture sector and the food sector represent the sectors with both the largest import and export virtual water quantities. China's global virtual water trade network has been relatively stable from 1995 to 2009. China has especially close relationships with the USA, Indonesia, India, Canada, Mexico, Brazil and Australia. Trade relations, resource endowment and supply-demand relationships may play key roles in China's global virtual water footprint network rather than geographical location. Finally, policy implications are proposed for China's long term sustainable water management and for global supply chain management in general.},

Both annual runoff and sediment load demonstrated significant reduction (p {$<$} 0.05) with decreasing rates of -3.2 x 10(6) m(3)/a and -1.09Mt/ a, respectively. The abrupt changes were detected in 1979 and 1996 for the runoff and sediment load. All the runoff and sediment indices (runoff, sediment load, runoff coefficient, and sediment concentration) exhibited remarkable reduction (p {$<$} 0.01). The climate variability contributed 24.4\% and 25.1\% during 1980-1996 and 1997-2010 to annual runoff decrease, respectively, and human activities accounted for the remaining 75.6\% and 74.9\%. In contrast, changes in precipitation accounted for 43.5\% and 20.2\% of sediment load reduction during 1980-1996 and 1997-2010, whereas the human activities contributed 56.5\% and 79.8\%, respectively. The relative contributions from climate variability and human activities to runoff and sediment load changes at annual scale were different from that at flood season scale. Results suggested the dominant role of soil and water conservations in the variation of runoff and sediment load in the catchment.},

  abstract = {Operations of amount of large and medium reservoirs have remarkably changed runoff and sediment loads, and consequently affected the fluvial processes intensively on the upper Yellow River. In this study, time series of runoff and sediment transport rates of four major hydrological stations on the upper Yellow River were used to analyze temporal and spatial variations of runoff and sediment loads. Mann-Kendall test and wavelet analysis were applied to analyze the datasets. Temporal variations in runoff and sediment loads were discerned in terms of changing trend, abrupt change year, and multi-periods from the time series. Additionally, a time series of runoffs was reconstructed based on a modeling scenario removing impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion to indicate the status without human disturbances. Comparison of the measured and reconstructed datasets was conducted to evaluate the impact of reservoir impoundment and water diversion on hydrological variations. The measured runoff and sediment loads showed obvious decreasing trends due to impoundment and water diversion. However, the reconstructed runoffs regarded as only affected by climate change showed no significant changing trend at a 95\% confidence level, confirming that, instead of climate change, human activities played the most important roles in variations. The measured datasets indicated that the reservoir construction and operation caused an abrupt change in runoff in 1986, while the reconstructed datasets indicated another abrupt change in 1995. Wavelet transform analysis distinguished the multi-periodical features of the time series. The first, second, and third dominant periodicities of the measured runoffs were 25-27, 16, and 8 years, respectively, whereas the first three dominant periodicities of the reconstructed runoffs were 26-31, 12, and 7 years, respectively. It was indicated that the high-frequency periodicities of runoffs decreased while the low-frequency periodicities increased, owing to reservoir impoundment and water diversion.},

However, prosociality is often limited to members of an in-group. We present a general theoretical model where society is split into subgroups and people care more about the welfare of others in their own subgroup than they do about those in out-groups. Individual contributions to the public good spill over and benefit members in each group to different degrees. We then consider special cases of our general model under which we can examine the consequences of localized prosociality for the economic outcomes of society as a whole. We ask to what extent prosociality closes the welfare gap between the Nash equilibrium without prosociality and the social optimum. The answer depends on whether private and public inputs are good or poor substitutes in producing final output. Critically, the degree to which this welfare gap closes is a concave function of the level of prosociality in the case of poor substitutes, so even low levels of prosociality can lead to social welfare near the social optimum.},

  abstract = {The chemical and isotopic characteristics of the water and suspended particulate materials (SPM) in the Yellow River were investigated on the samples collected from 29 hydrological monitoring stations in the mainstem and several major tributaries during 2004 to 2007. The delta D and delta O-18 values of the Yellow River water vary in large ranges from -32 parts per thousand to -91 parts per thousand and from -3.1 parts per thousand to -12.5 parts per thousand, respectively. The characters of H and O isotope variations indicate that the major sources of the Yellow River water are meteoric water and snow melting water, and water cycle in the Yellow River basin is affected strongly by evaporation process and human activity. The average SPM content (9.635 g/L) of the Yellow River is the highest among the world large rivers. Compared with the Yangtze River, the Yellow River SPM has much lower clay content and significantly higher contents of elastic silicates and carbonates. In comparison to the upper crust rocks, the Yellow River SPM contains less SiO2, CaO, K2O and Na2O, but more TFe2O3, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb and Cd. The abnormal high Cd contents found in some sample may be related to local industrial activity. The REE contents and distribution pattern of the Yellow River SPM are very close to the average value of the global shale. The average delta Si-30(SPM) in the Yellow River (-0.11 parts per thousand) is slightly higher than the average value (-0.22 parts per thousand) of the Yangtze River SPM. The major factors controlling the delta Si-30(SPM) of the Yellow River are the soil supply, the isotopic composition of the soil and the climate conditions. The TDS in the Yellow River are the highest among those of world large rivers. Fair correlations are observed among Cl-, Na+, K+, and Mg2+ contents of the Yellow River water, indicating the effect of evaporation. The Ca2+ and Sr2+ concentrations show good correlation to the SO42- concentration rather than HCO3- concentration, reflecting its origin from evaporates. The NO3- contents are affected by farmland fertilization. The Cu, Zn and Cd contents in dissolved load of the Yellow River water are all higher than those of average world large rivers, reflecting the effect of human activity. The dissolved load in the Yellow River water generally shows a REE distribution pattern parallel to those for the Yangtze River and the Xijiang River. The delta Si-30 values of the dissolved silicon vary in a range from 0.4 parts per thousand to 2.9 parts per thousand, averaging 1.34 parts per thousand. The major processes controlling the D-si and delta Si-30(Diss) of the Yellow River water are the weathering process of silicate rocks, growth of phytolith in plants, evaporation, dissolution of phytolith in soil, growth of fresh water diatom, adsorption and desorption of aqueous monosilicic acid on iron oxide and human activities. The average delta Si-30(Diss) value of the Yellow River is significantly lower than that of the Nile River, Yangtze River and Siberia rivers, but higher than those of other rivers, reflecting their differences in chemical weathering and biological activity. The delta S-34(SO4) values of the Yellow River water range from -3.8 parts per thousand to 14.1 parts per thousand, averaging 7.97 parts per thousand. There is some correlation between SO42- content and delta S-34(SO4). The factors controlling the delta S-34(SO4) of the Yellow River water are the SO4 in the meteoric water, the SO4 from gypsum or anhydrite in evaporite rocks, oxidation and dissolution of sulfides in the mineral deposits, magmatic rocks and sedimentary rocks, the sulfate reduction and precipitation process and the sulfate from fertilizer. The Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios of all samples range from 0.71041 to 0.71237, averaging 0.71128. The variations in the Sr-87/Sr-86 ratio and Sr concentration of river water are primarily caused by mixing of waters of various origins with different Sr-87/Sr-86 ratios and Sr contents resulting from water-rock interaction with different rock types.},

  abstract = {Although the water management sector is often characterized as resistant to risk and change, urban areas across the United States are increasingly interested in creating opportunities to transition toward more sustainable water management practices. These transitions are complex and difficult to predict \textendash{} the product of water managers acting in response to numerous biophysical, regulatory, political, and financial factors within institutional constraints. Gaining a better understanding of how these transitions occur is crucial for continuing to improve water management. This paper presents a replicable methodology for analyzing how urban water utilities transition toward sustainability. The method combines standardized quantitative measures of variables that influence transitions with contextual qualitative information about a utility's unique decision making context to produce structured, data-driven narratives. Data-narratives document the broader context, the utility's pretransition history, key events during an accelerated period of change, and the consequences of transition. Eventually, these narratives should be compared across cases to develop empirically-testable hypotheses about the drivers of and barriers to utility-level urban water management transition. The methodology is illustrated through the case of the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Department (WASD) in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and its transition toward more sustainable water management in the 2000s, during which per capita water use declined, conservation measures were enacted, water rates increased, and climate adaptive planning became the new norm.},

In the irrigated Green Revolution countries, an urban/rural blue water competition is emerging, driven by population growth, urban expansion, industrialization and new lifestyles. The problems are especially demanding in regions with depleted rivers and overexploited groundwater aquifers. For the billions of poor in the semiarid savanna regions, where rainfed smallholder farming dominates agriculture, a new type of agricultural revolution is called for, harvesting the potential of green water in the soil through conservation farming and rainwater harvesting. Due to this dichotomized problematique, water governance has to shift its focus from blue water and incorporate also green water linked to land use, and see rainfall as the manageable freshwater resource. To secure environmental sustainability, special efforts are called for to clarify water-related trade offs in balancing between human and ecosystem wellbeing.},

These models also offer challenges, as decisions need to be made by the modeler on trade-offs between generality, precision, and realism. In addition, traditional hydrologic model validation techniques, such as evaluating simulated streamflow, are insufficient, and new techniques must be developed. As socio-hydrology progresses, these models offer a robust, invaluable tool to test hypotheses about the relationships between aspects of coupled human-water systems. They will allow us to explore multiple working hypotheses to greatly expand insights and understanding of coupled socio-hydrologic systems.},

We identify 117 studies that aimed to estimate the causal effect of land tenure security interventions on these outcomes. Approximately two-thirds of these studies reported positive links between improved tenure security and human well-being or environmental outcomes. Close to half of the studies that examined social and environmental outcomes reported positive impacts on both. The majority of studies assessed government-implemented interventions that statutorily recognized rights through land titling and formalization in the 1990s and 2000s. More research is needed to bolster the body of evidence on the effects of non-technical interventions (for example, capacity building and awareness raising) and the devolution of rights to inform future land policy efforts and accelerate sustainable development.},

This paper reviews theoretical approaches to resolving this puzzle. Our discussion integrates ideas and concepts from evolutionary biology, anthropology, and political science. The evolutionary framework of multilevel selection suggests that complex hierarchies can arise in response to selection imposed by intergroup conflict (warfare). The logical coherency of this theory has been investigated with mathematical models, and its predictions were tested empirically by constructing a database of the largest territorial states in the world (with the focus on the preindustrial era).},

These are long-standing questions that have proven difficult to answer. To test between competing hypotheses, we constructed a massive repository of historical and archaeological information known as ``Seshat: Global History Databank.'' We systematically coded data on 414 societies from 30 regions around the world spanning the last 10,000 years. We were able to capture information on 51 variables reflecting nine characteristics of human societies, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems. Our analyses revealed that these different characteristics show strong relationships with each other and that a single principal component captures around three-quarters of the observed variation. Furthermore, we found that different characteristics of social complexity are highly predictable across different world regions. These results suggest that key aspects of social organization are functionally related and do indeed coevolve in predictable ways. Our findings highlight the power of the sciences and humanities working together to rigorously test hypotheses about general rules that may have shaped human history.},

We conducted a field experiment on groundwater monitoring in Cear\'a, Brazil, where communities are increasingly reliant on groundwater yet do not engage in monitoring. Despite careful implementation, uptake of monitoring within the 80 treatment communities was low. To unpack this low uptake, we conduct multimethods exploratory research. We find that uptake is less likely in communities facing high coordination costs, either within the community leadership or across the broader community. Uptake is also less likely when there are physical barriers to monitoring, when there are more substitutes for groundwater, and when there is lower variability in water availability. Our findings can inform future monitoring interventions in similar contexts worldwide.},

  abstract = {The focus of this study is on how changes in formal and informal institutions have differential impacts across populations in terms of vulnerability of livelihoods to drought, and the unequal processes that shape adaptation to new conditions. Drought vulnerability occurs as a result of exposure and sensitivity to interrelated economic, social, political, and ecological dynamics. There is a need for approaches that can evaluate how the ability to reduce these exposures and sensitivities becomes socially stratified. Building on our understanding of institutional and biophysical constraints in one pastoralist group ranch, we use an approach that draws on quantitative and qualitative data to combine analyses of entitlements, access, and adaptive capacity. We asked how, in a context of changing herding institutions, the ability to adapt to drought and other stressors, is differentiated among actors. We found that herders with higher livestock wealth are more likely to have entitlement sets that include factors that enable access to secure cattle grazing on private wildlife conservation lands, and access to more distant areas with herds of sheep and cattle \textendash{} two key means of reducing exposure to drought vulnerability, leading to greater coping ability during drought. Those with lower livestock wealth rely disproportionately on illicit, precarious access to external grazing resources. Higher livestock wealth families experienced disproportionately lower sensitivity to drought with smaller losses of cattle, and likely have decreased sensitivity to drought-related market fluctuations, while others are primarily reliant on small stock and/or precarious access pathways. However, rather than naturalize this differential ability as merely increased adaptive capacity for some that are better able to adapt to novel, local conditions, we argue this instead reflects the unequal footing that households find themselves on, in a shifting institutional landscape of structural and relational access constraints and reconfigurations of reciprocity, that are intertwined with interventions by state and non-state actors.},

The aim of the system described here was to collect data on discharge and sediment content during occasional summer storms. These data can be used for calibrating and validating the LISEM erosion model. A V-notch weir was selected since it can measure a wide range of discharges. The measurement structure was equipped with an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level. The system automatically switched on as soon as rain had been detected and the water level data were stored when a certain level threshold was surpassed. As a back-up system a flow meter was used, while a local farmer had also been hired to manually record water level during events. Sediment content of the runoff was determined on samples taken by an automatic sampler and a local farmer took additional samples. The system operated from April 1998 until September 2000. In this period, six events occurred and data could be collected during five of those. The data were corrected to make them useful for comparison with erosion simulation results. The collected data show that runoff only occurs during high-intensity rainstorms that produce more than about 11 mm of rain. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Abstract. In the current human-modified world, or Anthropocene, the state of water stores and fluxes has become dependent on human as well as natural processes. Water deficits (or droughts) are the result of a complex interaction between meteorological anomalies, land surface processes, and human inflows, outflows, and storage changes. Our current inability to adequately analyse and manage drought in many places points to gaps in our understanding and to inadequate data and tools. The Anthropocene requires a new framework for drought definitions and research. Drought definitions need to be revisited to explicitly include human processes driving and modifying soil moisture drought and hydrological drought development. We give recommendations for robust drought definitions to clarify timescales of drought and prevent confusion with related terms such as water scarcity and overexploitation. Additionally, our understanding and analysis of drought need to move from single driver to multiple drivers and from uni-directional to multi-directional. We identify research gaps and propose analysis approaches on (1)~drivers, (2)~modifiers, (3)~impacts, (4)~feedbacks, and (5)~changing the baseline of drought in the Anthropocene. The most pressing research questions are related to the attribution of drought to its causes, to linking drought impacts to drought characteristics, and to societal adaptation and responses to drought. Example questions include  (i) What are the dominant drivers of drought in different parts of the world?  (ii) How do human modifications of drought enhance or alleviate drought severity? (iii) How do impacts of drought depend on the physical characteristics of drought vs. the vulnerability of people or the environment? (iv) To what extent are physical and human drought processes coupled, and can feedback loops be identified and altered to lessen or mitigate drought? (v) How should we adapt our drought analysis to accommodate changes in the normal situation (i.e. what are considered normal or reference conditions) over time? Answering these questions requires exploration of qualitative and quantitative data as well as mixed modelling approaches. The challenges related to drought research and management in the Anthropocene are not unique to drought, but do require urgent attention. We give recommendations drawn from the fields of flood research, ecology, water management, and water resources studies. The framework presented here provides a holistic view on drought in the Anthropocene, which will help improve management strategies for mitigating the severity and reducing the impacts of droughts in future.},

  abstract = {To determine the resilience of complex social-ecological systems (SESs) it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of the system behavior under changing political, economic, and environmental conditions (i.e., external system stressors). Such behavior can be predicted if one knows the stable and unstable equilibrium states in a system and how these equilibria react to changes in the system stressors. The state of the system rapidly or gradually changes either toward (i.e., stable equilibrium) or away from (i.e., unstable equilibrium) an equilibrium. However, the equilibrium states in a SES are often unknown and difficult to identify in real systems. In contrast, agent-based SES models can potentially be used to determine equilibria states, but are rarely used for this purpose. We developed a generic approach to identify stable and unstable equilibria states with agent-based SES models. We used an agent-based SES model to simulate land-use change in an alpine mountain region in the Canton of Valais, Switzerland. By iteratively running this model for different input settings, we were able to identify equilibria in intensive and extensive agriculture. We also assessed the sensitivity of these equilibria to changes in external system stressors. With support-vector machine classifications, we created bifurcation diagrams in which the stable and unstable equilibria as a function of the values of a system stressor were depicted. The external stressors had a strong influence on the equilibrium states. We also found that a minimum amount of direct payments was necessary for agricultural extensification to take place. Our approach does not only provide valuable insights into the resilience of our case-study region to changing conditions, but can also be applied to other (agent-based) SES models to present important model results in a condensed and understandable format.},

  abstract = {The risk coping culture of a community plays a major role in the development of urban floodplains. In this paper we analyse, in a conceptual way, the interplay of community risk coping culture, flooding damage and economic growth. We particularly focus on three aspects: (i) collective memory, i.e., the capacity of the community to keep risk awareness high; (ii) risk-taking attitude, i.e., the amount of risk the community is collectively willing to be exposed to; and (iii) trust of the community in risk reduction measures. To this end, we use a dynamic model that represents the feedback between the hydrological and social system components. Model results indicate that, on the one hand, by under perceiving the risk of flooding (because of short collective memory and too much trust in flood protection structures) in combination with a high risk-taking attitude, community development is severely limited because of high damages caused by flooding. On the other hand, overestimation of risk (long memory and lack of trust in flood protection structures) leads to lost economic opportunities and recession. There are many scenarios of favourable development resulting from a trade-off between collective memory and trust in risk reduction measures combined with a low to moderate risk-taking attitude. Interestingly, the model gives rise to situations in which the development of the community in the floodplain is path dependent, i.e., the history of flooding may lead to community growth or recession.

  abstract = {An underlying understanding among adaptation and community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) scholars is the existence of important feedbacks between local resource management institutions and individual adaptive capacity. The relationship between CBNRM and individual adaptive capacity is of global concern given the ubiquity of CBNRM worldwide, the patent impacts of global changes at local levels, and the recent calls for the integration of climate and rural development policies. So far, however, there have not been formal, large-n studies of that relationship. This study aims to fill that gap by testing whether the performance of community-based water management institutions and communal land regimes have an impact on the effectiveness of farmers' adaptation responses to climatic and global market disturbances. For this purpose, the study relies on a unique dataset of individual and collective features obtained from water user associations (WUAs) and ejidos in Mexico. According to the regression results, well-functioning community-based water management institutions have a positive and significant impact on individual farmers' self-reported response effectiveness. The impact of communal land property is also significant but negative. These effects, which hold only in the context of climate disturbances but not market disturbances, can be explained by looking at the support given by the associations to farmers, and issues of communal land marginalization, respectively. Policies that strengthen the autonomy and capacity for cooperation of WUAs and ameliorate structural deficits in communal land regimes shall not only guarantee a long-advocated path for rural development but also help farmers deal with some of the climatic uncertainties that increasingly threaten agriculture.},

This paper briefly explores the evolution of global-scale studies of the hydrologic cycle and the pivotal role that humans play in shaping modern water systems. We review key concepts that emerged over the last one-to-two decades that have motivated acceptance of the legitimacy of a fully global-scale perspective. Advances in diagnosing the broad-scale syndromes today set the stage for a next phase of study, crafting science-based solutions for sustainable water development as part of the broader global Rio+20 agenda.},

As a result, the capacity of ecosystems to renew biomass, herein referred to as `biocapacity', is becoming the material bottleneck for the human economy. Yet, economic development theory and practice continue to underplay the importance of natural resources, most notably biological ones. We analysed the unequal exposure of national economies to biocapacity constraints. We found that a growing number of people live in countries with both biocapacity deficits and below-average income. Low income thwarts these economies' ability to compete for needed resources on the global market. By 2017, 72\% of humanity lived in such countries. This trend not only erodes their possibilities for maintaining progress but also eliminates their chances for eradicating poverty, a situation we call an `ecological poverty trap'.},

The phenomenal growth of the human footprint has significantly modified hydrological processes in various ways (e.g. irrigation, artificial dams, and water diversion) and at various scales (from a watershed to the globe). During the early 1990s, awareness of the potential for increased water scarcity led to the first detailed global water resource assessments. Shortly thereafter, in order to analyse the human perturbation on terrestrial water resources, the first generation of largescale hydrological models (LHMs) was produced. However, at this early stage few models considered the interaction between terrestrial water fluxes and human activities, including water use and reservoir regulation, and even fewer models distinguished water use from surface water and groundwater resources. Since the early 2000s, a growing number of LHMs have incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle, yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models remains challenging. In this paper we provide a synthesis of progress in the development and application of human impact modelling in LHMs. We highlight a number of key challenges and discuss possible improvements in order to better represent the human\textendash water interface in hydrological models.},

Porter proposed that stringent environmental regulation (under the condition that it is efficient) can lead to win-win situations, in which social welfare as well as the private net benefits of firms operating under such regulation can be increased. This paper analyses the Porter hypothesis with regard to two aspects. Firstly, it will analyse the theoretical reasoning behind the hypothesis by discussing and analyzing the arguments brought forward in favour of and against the hypothesis based on the discussion of different theoretical analyses and models by various authors in the field. Secondly, the paper reviews influential empirical studies trying to test the Porter hypothesis. The analysis of empirical work will allow (at least to some degree) to assess whether theoretical conclusions about the Porter hypothesis are confirmed by empirical research.},

By drawing on the cases of SES management in dryland areas, we propose three distinct but complementary approaches to promote SES fit based on comprehensive and systematic analyses, which can be summarized as structural, dynamic, and scale approaches. These approaches could contribute to enhance the fit of SES, but more quantitative indicators and tools are needed to analyze complex SES structure?function relationships.},

  abstract = {Based on the measured discharge, sediment load, and cross-sectional data from 1986 to 2015 for the lower Yellow River, changes in the morphological parameters (width, depth, and cross-sectional geomorphic coefficient) of the 01_manuscript channel are analyzed in this paper. The results show that before the operation of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir (XLDR) from 1986 to 1999, the 01_manuscript channel shrunk continually, with decreasing width and depth. The rate of reduction in its width decreased along the river whereas that of depth increased in the downstream direction. Because the rate of decrease in the width of the 01_manuscript channel was greater than that in channel depth, the cross-sectional geomorphic coefficient decreased in the sub-reach above Gaocun. By contrast, for the sub-reach below Gaocun, the rate of decrease in channel width was smaller than that in channel depth, and the cross-sectional geomorphic coefficient increased. Once the XLDR had begun operation, the 01_manuscript channel eroded continually, and both its width and depth increased from 2000 to 2015. The rate of increase in channel width decreased in the longitudinal direction, and the depth of the 01_manuscript channel in all sub-reaches increased by more than 2 m. Because the rate of increase in the depth of the 01_manuscript channel was clearly larger than that of its width, the cross-sectional geomorphic coefficient decreased in all sub-reaches. The cross-sectional geometry of the 01_manuscript-channel of the lower Yellow River exhibited different adjustment patterns before and after the XLDR began operation. Before its operation, the 01_manuscript channel mainly narrowed in the transverse direction and silted in the vertical direction in the sub-reach above Aishan; in the sub-reach below Aishan, it primarily silted in the vertical direction. After the XLDR began operation, the 01_manuscript channel adjusted by widening in the transverse direction and deepening in the vertical direction in the sub-reach above Aishan; in the sub-reach below it, the 01_manuscript channel adjusted mainly by deepening in the vertical direction. Compared with the rates of decrease in the width and depth of the 01_manuscript channel during the siltation period, the rate of increase in channel width during the scouring period was clearly smaller while the rate of increase in channel depth was larger. After continual siltation and scouring from 1986 to 2015, the cross-sectional geometry of the 01_manuscript-channel changed from wide and shallow to relatively narrow and deep. The pattern of adjustment in the 01_manuscript channel was closely related to the water and sediment conditions. For the braided reach, the cross-sectional geomorphic coefficient was negatively correlated with discharge and positively correlated with suspended sediment concentration (SSC) during the siltation period. By contrast, the cross-sectional geomorphic coefficient was positively correlated with discharge and negatively correlated with SSC during the scouring period. For the transitional and meandering reaches, the cross-sectional geomorphic coefficient was negatively correlated with discharge and positively correlated with SSC.},

  abstract = {Large hydrologic basins involve multiple stakeholders, and coupled dynamic social and ecological processes. Managing such basins has long been a challenge. Balancing the demand for water from nature against that from humans is always difficult, particularly in arid watersheds. Here, we analyze potential institutional causes of ecological degradation and how it can be reversed by introducing new forms of governance. The framework and assumptions are illustrated using China's second-largest endorheic basin, where empirical evidence shows that the introduction of a new governing authority connecting midstream and downstream actors facilitated the establishment of a new governance regime that is better aligned with the biophysical scales of the watershed. A trans-regional water allocation project initiated by the new higher-level authority successfully rescued downstream oases and restored a dried terminal lake. These outcomes suggest that when social and ecological structures are better aligned our ability to manage the interplay between social and ecological processes increases. However, the lack of direct connection between the actors of the middle and lower reaches resulted in the paradox of an increase in water demand. We therefore suggest that measures to stimulate the emergence of horizontal social ties linking different critical groups of actors across the watershed could further the alignment of the institutional and biophysical structures-without these changes sustainable management of river basins and other common pool resources will remain problematic.

The Johansen test and wavelet neural network were used to verify the cointegration relationship among hydrological series. Runoff-sediment uncertain statistical relations and dynamics in the MYRB were also analyzed based on rating curves and hysteresis loops. The results showed that the logarithmic sequences of sediment load (SL), runoff and suspended sediment concentration (SSC) conformed to a linear cointegration relationship at the Toudaoguai station or in spring, winter or under small flow at other stations, but a nonlinear cointegration relationship was observed in other cases at other stations. Regarding runoff-sediment uncertain relationships, the rating curves, and hysteresis loops differed in stations (Toudaoguai and the other stations), as well as discharge (threshold: 1000 m(3)/s), season (ice-flood and rainy season) and saturation of flow at flood and monthly scales. At the annual scale, phased and unsynchronized characteristics of runoff and sediment load were evident with a decreasing trend. This study on the runoff-sediment relationship can rationally provide a theoretical basis for the management and development of the Yellow River and other similar rivers with sufficient sediment, especially for areas with serious soil erosion.},

This study examines the variation trends in recorded runoff for the Xinshui River, a tributary of the Yellow River on the Loess Plateau, and uses hydrological simulations to investigate how climate change and human activity have contributed to those trends. Results show that the recorded runoff at the Daning station on the Xinshui River declined significantly from 1955-2008 with an abrupt change occurring in 1973. The Simplified Water Balance Model (SWBM) simulates monthly discharge well with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient of 78\% and a relative error of volumetric fit (RE) of 0.32\%. Runoff depth over the catchment in 1973-2008 fell by 25.5 mm relative to the previous period, with human activity and climate change contributing 60.6\% and 39.4\% of the total runoff reduction, respectively. However, the impacts induced by climate change and human activities are both tending to increase. Therefore, efforts to improve the ecology of the Loess Plateau should give sufficient attention to the impacts of climate change and human activity.},

  abstract = {Dissolved aluminum (Al) is a sensitive tracer for biogeochemical cycles in the ocean. There has been a dramatic decline in water and sediment fluxes into the sea from the Huanghe because of climate change and human activities. Water-Sediment Regulation Schemes (WSRSs) have been implemented annually to flush trapped sediments from the upstream watercourse and reservoirs of the river. Monthly observations to investigate the behavior of dissolved Al in the lower reach of the Huanghe were carried out from November 2008 to December 2010. During 2009, daily observations were made to assess the impact of the ninth WSRS on the lower reach of the Huanghe and three cruises were carried out in the Huanghe Estuary in 2009 (prior to, during and following the WSRS). The monthly concentrations of dissolved Al ranged from 25 nM to 362 nM (average 90 nM) in the lower reach of the Huanghe. Assessment of the seasonal variation of dissolved Al showed that the highest concentrations occurred in summer and the lowest in winter: these corresponded to the variations in water discharge and sediment loads, which were controlled by WSRS events. During the ninth WSRS events in 2009 the daily runoff and sediment load increased from 200 m(3)/s to 3600 m(3)/s and from 0.1 g/L to 5 g/L, respectively. The concentration of dissolved Al increased from 180 nM to 600 nM (average 380 nM) in less than 20 days, which were equivalent to 43\% of the annual Al flux into the Bohai. Exchange between dissolved and particulate Al, investigated using a simple sorption model based on the distribution coefficient (K-d), was approximately 10(6) mL/g in the Huanghe. The average concentrations of dissolved Al in the Huanghe Estuary prior to, during and following the WSRS were 243 nM, 238 nM and 186 nM, respectively. The comparable concentrations of dissolved Al in the Huanghe Estuary prior to and during the WSRS indicate that removal processes occurred in the initial stages of mixing in the estuary. The Al-salinity relationship and laboratory mixing experiments demonstrated that dissolved Al has a non-conservative behavior in the Huanghe Estuary, where a significant loss (20-50\%) occurred. The mechanism of removal of dissolved Al in the Huanghe Estuary was adsorption onto suspended particulate matter and salt-induced flocculation. These observations suggest that human activities (e.g. the WSRSs) and sorption processes dominate the geochemical interactions of Al in the Huanghe and its estuary. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

The results obtained were as follows: (1) Vegetation greening was remarkable in the entire study region (0.036 yr(-1)). The increasing rate was higher in wetter conditions with AI {$<$} 3 (0.036-0.053 yr(-1)) than arid regions with AI {$>$} 3 (0.012-0.024 yr(-1)). (2) Vegetation improved faster for converted forestland, shrubland, and grassland than unconverted types under similar drying conditions. Converted shrubland and grassland had a larger relative change than converted forestland. (3) Converted land use types generally exhibited stronger fluctuation than unconverted types with small differences among types. (4) Vegetation exhibited a sustainable increasing trend in the future, which accounted for more than 73.1\% of the region, mainly distributed in the middle reach of the Yellow River. Vegetation restoration exerted important influences on vegetation greening and the effect was stronger for converted types than unconverted types.},

This paper applies an analytical framework focused on adaptation, institutions, and livelihoods to study climate adaptation in the Mongolian grasslands. A household survey was designed and implemented in each of three broad vegetation types in Mongolia and Inner Mongolia. The analytical results show that livelihood adaptation strategies of herders vary greatly across the border between Mongolia and Inner Mongolia, China. Local institutions played important roles in shaping and facilitating livelihood adaptation strategies of herders. Mobility and communal pooling were the two key categories of adaptation strategies in Mongolia, and they were shaped and facilitated by local communal institutions. Storage, livelihood diversification, and market exchange were the three key categories of adaptation strategies in Inner Mongolia, and they were mainly shaped and facilitated by local government and market institutions. Local institutions enhanced but also at times undermined adaptive capacity of herder communities in the two countries, but in different ways. Sedentary grazing has increased livelihood vulnerability of herders to climate variability and change. With grazing sedentarization, the purchase and storage of forage has become an important strategy of herders to adapt to the highly variable climate. The multilevel statistical models of forage purchasing behaviors show that the strategies of livestock management, household financial capital, environmental (i.e., precipitation and vegetation growth) variability, and the status of pasture degradation were the major determinants of this adaptation strategy.},

This paper focuses on soil and water conservation (SWC) policy in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China. The problems, rural poverty, severe soil erosion, great sediment loads and high flood risks, are analyzed over the period of 1949-present using the Driving force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework as a way to organize analysis of the evolution of SWC policy. Three stages are identified in which SWC policy interacts differently with institutional, financial and technology support. In Stage 1(1949-1979), SWC policy focused on rural development in eroded areas and on reducing sediment loads. Local farmers were mainly responsible for SWC The aim of Stage 2(1980-1990) was the overall development of rural industry and SWC. A more integrated management perspective was implemented taking a small watershed as a geographic interactional unit. This approach greatly improved the efficiency of SWC activities. In Stage 3 (1991 till now), SWC has been treated as the 01_manuscript measure for natural resource conservation, environmental protection, disaster mitigation and agriculture development. Prevention of new degradation became a priority. The government began to be responsible for SWC, using administrative, legal and financial approaches and various technologies that made large-scale SWC engineering possible. Over the historical period considered, with the implementation of the various SWC policies, the rural economic and ecological system improved continuously while the sediment load and flood risk decreased dramatically. The findings assist in providing a historical perspective that could inform more rational, scientific and effective natural resource management going forward. (C) 2014 The Authors.

  abstract = {Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) transported by runoff has been identified as an important role in the global carbon cycle. Despite there being many studies on DOC concentration and flux, little information is available for the semi-arid catchments of the Loess Plateau region (LPR). The primary goal of this study was to quantify DOC exported and driven by a sequence of rainfall events during the concentrated rainfall season. In addition, factors that affect DOC export from a small headwater catchment will be investigated accordingly. Runoff discharge and DOC concentration were monitored at the outlet of the Yangjuangou catchment in Yanan, Shaanxi Province, China. The results showed that DOC concentration was highly variable, with event-based DOC concentrations ranging from 5.14 to 13.14 mg L-1. Hysteresis analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between DOC concentration and flow rate in the hydrological process. The monthly DOC flux loading from the catchment was varied from 94.73 to 110.17 kg km(-2), while the event-based DOC flux ranged from 0.18 to 2.84 kg km(-2) in the period of June to September. Variations of event-driven DOC concentration contributed slightly to a difference in DOC flux, whereas intra-events of rainfall amount and runoff discharge led to evident differences in DOC export. In conclusion, our case results highlighted the advantages of high-frequency monitoring for DOC export and indicated that event-driven DOC export is largely influenced by the interaction of catchment hydrology and antecedent condition within a catchment. Engineers and scientists can take advantage of the derived results to better develop advanced field monitoring work. In addition, more studies are needed to investigate the magnitude of terrestrial DOC export in response to projected climate change at larger spatio-temporal scales, which may have implications for the carbon balance and carbon cycle model from an ecologically restored catchment in the LPR.},

Here, we used the past 60 years of runoff and sediment load observations to investigate the middle reach of the YR, i.e., the Loess Plateau (LP), the source of nearly 90\% of the sediment load of the river. We found that a sharp (58\%) reduction of sediment after 1979 was mainly (59\%) caused by a water yield decrease. Engineering and vegetation measures have induced land surface modifications, which are responsible for 76\% of the water reduction. These measures have been implemented as part of a coordinated set of soil and water conservation, and sediment control polices. We propose the cessation of such construction and the maintenance of a sustainable (i.e., minimal water consumption) vegetated ecosystem on the LP for soil conservation, and the establishment of an integrated basin-wide ecosystem and land use management regime for sustainable water use and sediment regulation.

  abstract = {The Yellow River, the second largest river in China, has during historical time been known as the "Yellow sorrow", because of the frequent flooding disasters in the lower reaches of the river. However, the situation is now reversed; during the dry season the water flow ceases intermittently in parts of the lower reaches. This happened for the first time in 1960; after 1972 frequently and from 1992 every year. The longest period without any water flow occurred in 1997, lasting for 226 days and extending 700 km upstream from the river mouth. The 01_manuscript reason for the seasonal interruption of flow is the artificial diversion of water for urban and farmland water supply which infringes on, and sometimes exhausts the natural flow volume. A contributing reason for the river drought is the climatic warming trend coupled with up to 10\% reduction in precipitation. Even though measures were initiated in 1998 for control of water usage in the upper and middle streams, there were still 137 days in 1998 and 43 days in 1999 without supply of water to parts of lower Yellow River channel. Not until the year 2000 was it possible to eliminate the drought events by artificial control. The diversion of river water for irrigation and urban water supply is continually increasing and now reaches 27 to 30x10(9) m(3)/year; more than one half of the river's total water discharge. As a result the removal of water upstream consumes the total supply during parts of the dry season, leaving no water for the lower reaches of the river. In order to maintain a net flow of 10x10(9)m(3)/year in the lower water course it would be necessary to limit artificial diversion to the order of 20x10(9) m(3)/year. The modern river delta of the Yellow River had progressed seaward and deposited about 600-km(2) new land since 1976 when the river changed its course and continued to the sea through the Qingshuigou channel. However, during 1990's the water volume and sediment load decreased rapidly to low values only about 1/4 of the annual value during preceding 50-year period. As a result, the submarine portion of the Yellow River delta has been eroded and retreated rapidly at a rate of 0.5 similar to 1.51cm/year. Thus, the Yellow River delta has changed from depositional to erosional regime.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River delta is dynamic because the river carries a heavy sediment load and serious siltation occurs in the area. Massive sediment transport brings fertile soil to the river mouth leading to its expansion by 20-25 km(2) per year. The dramatic reduction in runoff and sediment in the delta due to increasing water demand has extended the period of flow cutoff. The river changes its delta channel about once every ten years. The channel shifts affect the upstream flood stages. Since the river shifted to the present delta channel in 1976, the shape of the delta has changed remarkably. Sediment-laden flow has been building channels by depositing sediment in low velocity areas, and has extended the river mouth into the sea for more than 40 km. The velocity of sea currents is enhanced by the growth of the river mouth spit at a rate of 1 m s(-1) per 10-km extension, which results in high capacity of sea currents carrying sediment away from the mouth. The new river mouth area was silted up by 14 m and the old river mouth area was eroded by 5 m. Siltation takes place in the low flow season and scouring occurs in the flood season; scouring occurs during the rising limb of a flood and siltation occurs during the receding limb of a flood. The roughness of the river changes largely following the increase in discharge. The minimum Manning roughness occurs at non-siltation and non-erosion discharge. Tidal influence in the river is restricted to a section extending over only a few kilometres. Unlike in many other coastal areas, the river water with its high sediment concentration develops into density current and flows underneath the seawater during flood. This mechanism contributes to sediment transportation in the delta. Copyright (C) 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The land resources reduce had seriously affected the regional stability and the effective operation of wetland ecosystems. this paper used the remote sensing technology which can timely and accurately reflect the dynamic evolution of the coastline, combined the data from the Lijin station, interpreted and recognized the remote sensing images, analyzed the erosion of the coastline of the Diaokou River after the diversion of the Yellow River, the recovery of coastline after ecological replenishment and the silting process of the Qingshuigou river after the diversion. Results: In the Diaokou River, the erosion area of the sand mouth is about 2.826 km(2), the siltation area is about 3.156 km(2), and the net siltation area is 0.33 km(2), and the western convex bank is mostly eroded, the eastern concave bank is mostly silted; In the Qingshuigou River, the total land accretion area showed an increasing trend, the increment of land area was 300 km(2) and the average sedimentation rate was 7.56 km(2)yr(-1).

  abstract = {Sustainability of agricultural landscapes depends largely on land-use practices. As one of the most productive and widespread agricultural soils, loess is often deep and easily eroded, posing grand challenges for environmental sustainability around the world. One prime example is the Loess Plateau of China, which has been cultivated for more than 7500 years. Based on long-term data sets, this study demonstrates that the dominant agricultural practice, winter wheat cropping, continues to be the primary driver for the massive soil erosion and landscape modifications on the Loess Plateau. This traditional farming system is asynchronous with the dynamic rhythm between natural vegetation and climate in the region. In particular, the long summer fallow period for winter wheat fields is concurrent with the heavy-rainstorm season, which greatly accelerates soil erosion. Our finding indicates that common land-use practices that have lasted for thousands of years in China are not environmentally sustainable. Agriculture in this region has relied primarily on the continuous "mining'' of the soil for the past several thousand years but does not have a one-thousand-year future because of myriad environmental and socioeconomic factors associated with soil erosion. To contain soil erosion and promote sustainability on the Loess Plateau, therefore, a change in the agricultural regime is needed to make sure that current and future agricultural practices follow the vegetation-climate rhythm. In addition, to achieve environmental, economic, and social sustainability in this region, multifunctional land-use planning is required to increase landscape diversity and functions (e.g., proper arrangement of crop fields, orchards, and protected areas).},

Our estimation shows that wildfire damages in 2018 totalled \$148.5 (126.1\textendash 192.9) billion (roughly 1.5\% of California's annual gross domestic product), with \$27.7 billion (19\%) in capital losses, \$32.2 billion (22\%) in health costs and \$88.6 billion (59\%) in indirect losses (all values in US\$). Our results reveal that the majority of economic impacts related to California wildfires may be indirect and often affect industry sectors and locations distant from the fires (for example, 52\% of the indirect losses\textemdash 31\% of total losses\textemdash in 2018 were outside of California). Our findings and methods provide new information for decision makers tasked with protecting lives and key production sectors and reducing the economic damages of future wildfires.},

Nonetheless, losses of ecosystem services accelerate more rapidly than ever. As humans interact with nature, increasing their global presence in both scale and intensity, the need for a new macroeconomic world emerges. This world should be based on an integration of nature and society (nature-societal) or society and ecosystems (socio-ecosystem), which will facilitate the transition toward sustainable ecosystem services management. Achieving this new macroeconomic economic paradigm would require redesigning a new thought process that embraces ecosystem services as precious goods, rather than unlimited and free, unappreciated resources. Market and government are not sufficient for this new macro-economics, in which ecosystem services are its 01_manuscript content. We suggest an integrated set of market, government, and human values to manage ecosystem services, as traditional, narrow, economic, political and scientific solutions alone do not adequately address the sustainable use of natural ecosystems. Culture, created from human values which, to a certain extent, can be influenced or directed, has the capacity to influence the interactions between nature, social and economic systems. The ancient Chinese philosophy of 'unity of man with nature' provides principles which can guide and develop human values into a new, positive force with the potential to harmoniously manage sustainable ecosystem services.},

In this study, we analyzed the effects of permafrost degradation on the hydrological regime via four hydrological variables for 10 unregulated catchments in the source regions of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers. The results demonstrate that catchments with high permafrost coverage are expected to have an increased winter discharge ratio (proportion of winter discharge contribution to total annual flow), a decreased recession coefficient and a decreased ratio of Q(max)/Q(min) due to permafrost degradation. However, the great storage effects of lakes and wetlands, which could contribute to more groundwater instead of direct surface discharge, may affect the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation and result in the abnormal performance at catchment scale. The correlation analysis between summer precipitation (July-September) and the following winter discharge (December-February) indicates that permafrost degradation may affect the redistribution of summer precipitation towards the following winter discharge via increasing the soil storage capacity and delaying the release of water into streams in permafrost regions. However, unlike the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, no significant changes for the hydrological regime (four hydrological variables) are detected over the individual periods of records for each catchment. Decreased precipitation in summer seems to reduce the water infiltration to supply the groundwater, which weakens the effects of permafrost degradation on the hydrological regime. This study implies that the storage effects of lakes and wetlands and the changes of summer precipitation patterns should be considered in future permafrost hydrological simulations, which have suggested that a large increase in groundwater discharge to streams will likely occur in response to permafrost degradation due to the warming climate in the ideal scenario.},

The treatments comprised wheat stubble cover (WS) and traditional plowing (TP) in runoff plots (4.0m x 1.0 m) with three slope gradients (5, 10, and 15 degrees) under simulated rainfall at 80 mm h(-1) for 1 h. The runoff volume from WS plots was significantly less than that from TP. The runoff reduction with WS ranged from 91.92 to 92.83\% compared with TP. The runoff rates varied with the runoff volume in the same manner. The infiltration amount was higher with WS (94.896.2\% of rainwater infiltrated) than TP (35.4-57.1 \%). The sediment concentration was significantly lower with WS than TP. Compared with TP (304.31-731.23 g m(-2)), the sediment losses were reduced dramatically in WS (2.41-3.78 gm(-2)) and the sediment loss slightly increased with slope; however, it was greatly increased as slope increased in TP. These results revealed that the stubble cover was the 01_manuscript factor reducing runoff and sediment losses and improving infiltration and that stubble showed a great potential to control erosion and conserve soil and water resources during the summer fallow period in the Loess Plateau region.},

Based on Pb-210 and Cs-137 dating, the average sedimentation rate of core 11 was estimated to be 1.0 cm y(-1). Vertical,, distributions of natural radionuclides ((238)u Th-232 Ra-226 and K-40) changed dramatically, reflecting great changes in sediment input. Concentrations of U-238, Th-232, Ra-226 and K-40 all had significant positive relationships with organic matter and clay content, but their distributions were determined by different factors. Factor analysis showed that U-238 was determined by the river sediment input while Ra-226 was mainly affected by the seawater erosion. Environmental changes such as river channel migrations and sediment discharge variations could always cause changes in the concentrations of radionuclides. High concentrations of U-238 and Ra-226 were consistent with high accretion rate. Frequent seawater intrusion decreased the concentration of Ra-226 significantly. The value of U-238,(226) Ra tended to be higher when the sedimentation rate was low and tide intrusion was frequent. In summary, environmental evolutions in the estuary coastal wetland could be recorded by the vertical profiles of natural radionuclides. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Sedentary grazing with substantial external inputs has increased the cost of livestock production. As a result, the livelihoods of herders have become more vulnerable to climate variability and change. Sedentary grazing is the formal institutional arrangement in Inner Mongolia, China. However, this may not be an efficient institutional arrangement for climate change adaptation. Self-organized local institutions for climate change adaptation have emerged and are under development in the study area. In this study, we did exploratory analyses of multiple local institutions for climate change adaptation in the Mongolian grasslands, using an agent-based modeling approach. Empirical studies from literature and our field work show that sedentary grazing, pasture rental markets, and reciprocal pasture-use groups are three popular institutional arrangements in the study area. First, we modeled the social\textendash ecological performance (i.e., livelihood benefits to herders and grassland quality) of these institutions and their combinations under different climate conditions. Second, we did exploratory analyses of multiple social mechanisms for facilitating and maintaining cooperative use of pastures among herders. The modeling results show that in certain value-ranges of some model parameters with assumed values, reciprocal pasture-use groups had better performance than pasture rental markets; and the comparative advantage of cooperative use of pastures over sedentary grazing without cooperation becomes more evident with the increase in drought probability. Agent diversity and social norms were effective for facilitating the development of reciprocal pasture-use groups. Kin selection and punishments on free-riders were useful for maintaining cooperation among herders.},

  abstract = {The biotic mechanisms underlying ecosystem functioning and stability have been extensively \textemdash{} but separately \textemdash{} explored in the literature, making it difficult to understand the relationship between functioning and stability. In this study, we used community models to examine how complementarity and selection, the two major biodiversity mechanisms known to enhance ecosystem biomass production, affect ecosystem stability. Our analytic and simulation results show that while complementarity promotes stability, selection impairs it. The negative effects of selection on stability operate through weakening portfolio effects and selecting species that have high productivity but low tolerance to perturbations (``risk-prone'' species). In contrast, complementarity enhances stability by increasing portfolio effects and reducing the relative abundance of risk-prone species. Consequently, ecosystem functioning and stability exhibit either a synergy, if complementarity effects prevail, or trade-off, if selection effects prevail. Across species richness levels, ecosystem functioning and stability tend to be positively related, but negative relationships can occur when selection co-varies with richness. Our findings provide novel insights for understanding the functioning-stability relationship, with potential implications for both ecological research and ecosystem management.},

  abstract = {Aeolian and fluvial interactions (AFIs) are critical earth-surface processes in arid zones, especially in desert watersheds. The response of hyper-concentrated flows to seasonal alternate AFIs shows very high rates of sediment transport and has important environmental and ecological consequences from local to global scales. Here, we present the aeolian processes-induced hyper-concentrated (AHC) flows that occurred in the Sudalaer desert watershed upstream of the Yellow River, which primarily transport non-cohesive coarse aeolian sand ({$>$}0.08 mm) and show a peak suspended sediment concentration (SSC) of 1.1 to 1.4 x 10(6) mg l(-3). Our field study and theoretical analysis indicate that non-cohesive coarse aeolian sand downstream in the channel can be entrained from the bed and can be suspended in the turbulent flow by the significant runoff generated upstream with a SSC yo value of 0.5 x 10(6) mg l(-3). Severe aeolian processes can provide an abundant coarse sediment supply in the channel, which, once entrained, can also trigger and promote the development of AHC flows. We define, for the first time, the ratio of the weight percentage of coarse sediment to fine sediment C{$>$}(0.08) (mm)/C-{$<$}0.05 (mm) as the optimal grain size indicator (OGI) in suspended sediment, indicating that, as the fraction of coarse sediment increases; the significant runoff gradually changes to hyper-concentrated flows and reaches the peak SSC when OGI = 3.25. Due to-the high frequency of sandstorms and the infrequency of rainstorms, most of the significant rainfall -induced runoff with a certain SSC gamma(0) can develop into AHC flows and can substantially contribute to the total sediment yield, even leading to deleterious effects on the downstream river system and ecology. Compared with other desert watersheds in semiarid regions, we propose that a SSC gamma(0) of 500 kg m(-3) is the threshold criteria for the occurrence of AHC flows in the arid desert watersheds. Comprehensive governing of soil erosion in the upstream gully-dissected slopes is an essential and effective measure for controlling AHC flows. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Climate change is a global environmental issue, which is challenging water resources management and practices. This study investigates the impact of climate change on water resources of the Yellow River basin, a major grain-producing area in China, and provides recommendations on strategies to increase adaptive capacity and resilience in the basin region. Results show that the recorded stream flows of the Yellow River declined from 1951 to 2010 and have decreased significantly in the middle and lower reaches. The variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model performs well as a tool to simulate monthly discharge of both the tributary catchments and the whole Yellow River basin. Temperature across the Yellow River basin over 2021-2050 is expected to continue to rise with an average rates of approximately 0.039-0.056 A degrees C/annum. The average annual precipitation in the basin is projected to increase by 1.28-3.29 \% compared with the 1991-2010 baseline. Runoff during 2021-2050 is projected to decrease by 0.53-9.67 \% relative to 1991-2010 with high decadal and spatial variability. This is likely due to the model's projections of a significant rise in temperature and changes in precipitation patterns. Climate change will likely aggravate the severity and frequency of both water shortages and flooding in the basin region. It is therefore essential to devote sufficient attention on structural and non-structural measures for the Yellow River basin to cope with climate change. At the global level, strategies to increase adaptive capacity and build resilience to climate change focus on public education to improve awareness of climate risks, implementing the integrated water resources management and planning based on impact assessments.},

  abstract = {Climate change is expected to have substantial impacts on flow regime in the Upper Yellow River (UYR) basin that is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in the world. These impacts will most possibly exert negative effects on the habitat availability for riverine species. Thus, it is necessary to understand the alteration of river flow regime under climate scenarios. In this paper, we use the modified hydrological model HBV in conjunction with three general circulation models under three representative concentration pathways (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5) to address changes in flow regime under climate change for the UYR basin in the mid-term (2050s) and end-term (2080s) of the twenty-first century. Flow regime is quantified using the Indicators of hydrological alteration approach. Thereafter, the potential threats to riverine ecosystem in the UYR basin are identified based on the projected alterations of various flow characteristics and their ecological influences. The results showed that the magnitude of monthly flow would increase during the dry period. The date of the annual 1-day minimum streamflow will likely shift toward earlier time under different scenarios, and significant increases in magnitude of annual minimum flow of different durations were detected under both RCP 4.5 and 8.5 scenarios in the 2080s. In addition, assessments of the modification degree of the overall flow regime revealed that climate change would remarkably modify (medium level) the overall flow regime in the UYR basin, particularly by the end of the twenty-first century or under the high emission scenarios. Besides, destruction of habitat and reduced availability of food induced by substantially increased hydrological instability in the 2080s would make two endangered fishes more vulnerable in the UYR basin. These findings provide insights into potential adaptive countermeasures for water resource management and environmental system restoration in the Upper Yellow River.},

  abstract = {River channel occupation has made cities in the mountainous areas more vulnerable to floodwater out of river channels during rapid global urbanization. A better understanding of the influence of river channel occupation on urban flood disasters can serve as a reference in planning effective urban flood control strategies. In this study, taking a flood event that occurred on July 26th, 2017 in a city on the Loess Plateau as an example, field surveys, dynamics detection of the river channel using remote sensing technology, and scenario simulations with a two-dimensional flow and sediment model were utilized to quantitatively analyze the impacts of river channel occupation on urban inundation and sedimentation. The results show that river channel dynamics reduced by construction can be successfully detected using the combination of high-resolution images and Landsat time-series images. The variation of the water level-discharge relationship caused by the narrowing of the river channel and the increase of the flood-water level caused by water-blocking bridges/houses result in a significant reduction of the flood discharge capacity. The contribution of the narrowing of the river channel was 72.3\% for the total area inundated by floodwater, whereas 57.2\% of urban sedimentation was caused by the construction of bridges/houses within the river channel. Sustainable flood mitigation measures were also recommended according to the investigations and research findings in this study in order to reduce the social, environmental and economic damages caused by floods.},

  abstract = {The Lower Yellow River (LYR) has been characterized as a frequently breaching, overflowing and shifting river in historical periods. Understanding the factors that influence the LYR variations is critical for river management and disaster prevention. This study constructed a spatio-temporal data base of the LYR's breaching and overflowing events (BOEs) and course-shifting events (CSEs) occurring in the late Holocene. The data base and corresponding solar activity data were analyzed to determine the overall influence, temporal influence and spatial influence of solar activity on the LYR. Results showed that 75.5\% of the LYR CSEs and 61.7\% of the LYR BOEs occurred in sunspot number decline phases of 11 yr solar cycles, suggesting that the LYR changed more frequently during the sunspot number decline phases. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon was further interpreted as the high correlation between sunspot decline phases and heavy rainfall in the middle reaches of Yellow River (MYR). Five of the six heavy rainfall years over the last 60 years and 14 of the 16 well-known heavy rainfall records from 132 BC to AD 1933 in the MYR occurred in sunspot decline phases. Heavy rainfall in the MYR promoted the increase of the LYR runoff and the sediment rate and then raised the possibility of the occurrence of BOEs and CSEs. The study also found that the frequency of BOEs was positively related to the fluctuation amplitude of the sunspot maximum intensity in long time series. The flow directions of the LYR courses were found to affect the influence of solar activity on BOEs. The highest correlation between sunspot decline phases and BOEs was presented during the lifetime of eastward flows while the lowest during the lifetime of northward flows. In addition, human activities may undermine the impact of solar activities on the LYR changes.},

  abstract = {In the section of the Middle Yellow River from Longmen to the Sanmenxia Dam, the prediction to hyperconcentrated flood processes is difficult because of the abrupt change of channel geometry along the river and the high variability of the amount of flood water and sediment load from the 01_manuscript river and tributaries. A river network model based on a Godunov-type FVM scheme is proposed in order to investigate the flow dynamics, sediment transport and bed evolution during hyperconcentrated floods. A quasi 2D algorithm is adopted to calculate the velocity at the junction cell, which is then used for providing the interior boundary conditions. The computation for each reach can be executed simultaneously and the solution procedure is parallelized using OpenMP. The speedup factor compared with a serial program increases linearly in theory with the number of reaches in the river network. Two flood events, featuring significant erosion and deposition respectively, were simulated to validate the model. The calculated water levels, discharges and fractional concentrations of non-uniform suspended load were in agreement with the measurements. A comparison was made between the proposed model and an existing model neglecting the momentum conservation principle at the junction, with the former showing better prediction of the peak water levels near the confluence. Numerical experiments were conducted to analyze the influences of reservoir operation and discharge capacity of the dam on flood routing and bed evolution in the river network. It is demonstrated that decreasing pool level during flood season and increasing discharge capacity are both valid measures to alleviate sedimentation in the Sanmenxia Reservoir, and the former measure is a prerequisite. Therefore, the model presented here can help to enhance the understanding of river network system subject to high sediment input and inspire better strategies on sustainable reservoir management.},

  abstract = {Spatial mismatch often occurs between high-supply and high-demand regions of ecosystem services (ES), as human dwellings and workplaces are usually distant from natural ecosystems. In this regard, studies have increasingly focused on ecosystem service flows (ESF) from ecosystems to humans. However, current mapping methods for ESF are rarely able to visually display the flow relationships between supply and demand regions. Network models that commonly used for dealing with relational data show great potential in mapping ESF. Here, we demonstrated the effectiveness of the network model in mapping ESF by constructing a freshwater service flow network for the Yanhe watershed in China. We concluded that from 2000 to 2015 freshwater demand was approaching the limit of freshwater supply in the Yanhe watershed, with the freshwater demand continuously increasing. Due to the shortage of freshwater service, the deficit nodes and stop-flowing edges in the freshwater service flow network increased, and the network density decreased. These results can provide useful information to guide watershed freshwater resource management (e.g. optimizing the allocation of freshwater resources across the watershed and designing payment schemes for freshwater service) in the Yanhe watershed, particularly in a time of population growth, climate change, and threats of water scarcity. Finally, we pointed out that applications of the network model in ESF deserves more attention and further study and analyzed the wide applicability of the network model in mapping ESF and the possible future efforts in this field.},

Based on the annual streamflow series of Toudaoguai, Longmen, Sanmenxia, Huayuankou, Gaocun, and Lijin stations located in the Yellow River in China, the Mann-Kendall and Mann-Whitney-Pettitt methods were used to identify change-points. Thereafter, the power law distributions of the daily streamflow series before and after abrupt changes were studied based on the two-parameter power law distribution method. The results reveal that, firstly, under the influence of human activities, abrupt changes have taken place in the streamflow series of the Yellow River, mainly in the storage year of large reservoirs. Secondly, the daily streamflow series at four out of six stations obey a power law distribution, however, with short tails. The power law characteristics of the series before the abrupt change are essentially consistent with the entire streamflow series; however, these characteristics gradually disappear after abrupt changes. Thirdly, human activities are the 01_manuscript factors underlying the variations in the power law distribution of daily streamflow in different periods. This study provides a way for the study of streamflow changes in the Yellow River and may also offer a scientific basis for water resources development and ecological restoration.},

  abstract = {In this study we developed an impact factor formula (IFF) to quantitatively attribute separately the impacts of climate change and local human activities on hydrological response (i.e. run-off) in a sub-basin of Yellow River for the period 1950-2000.Using the daily climatic data, we first calibrated and verified the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) hydrological model to the baseline period 1955-1970. Then we developed the basin's natural run-off for the following three decades (1971-2000) using the VIC model without considering local human impacts, as the VIC model is benchmarked by the 1960's hydrological regime. On the basis of observed precipitation, run-off and reconstructed natural run-off data from 1971 to 2000, we quantified their long-term trend, decadal and annual variations. Using daily climatic observations, we showed that the precipitation and run-off have decreased from the baseline decade, the 1960s, indicating a drier hydrological regime for recent decades. We further applied the IFF to quantitatively attribute separately the impacts of reduced precipitation and increased temperatures from climate change and then of local human activities on hydrological run-off response. It was found that climate change has a greater impact than human activities on the basin's run-off for the three consecutive decades. The pCC (percentage change of run-off due to climate change impact) is found to be 89\% followed by 66\% and 56\% in 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, respectively. Over the decades, pHA (percentage change of run-off due to human activities) has continuously increased from 11\% to 44\%. If the trend continues, in future, the pHA is going to outweigh pCC in this basin. This study provides a quantitative assessment methodology for water resources managers to understand the changing process of the hydrological cycle and attribute its causative factors in a sub-basin of the Yellow River.

The health evaluation, or diagnoses, of an eco-economy at the small watershed scale requires the integrated analysis of ecological, economic, and social factors, yet few studies have achieved this. The health of an eco-economy comprises three components: vigor, organization, and resilience. We use an analytic hierarchy process to develop a health evaluation index system that evaluates the health of an eco-economy system. We then use this diagnostic method to explore the factors affecting the health status of a semi-arid loess watershed in China in 2007 and 2009. The results show that between 2007 and 2009 the health status of the eco-economy improved from the better stage to the benign circle stage. The primary productivity of grassland, land productivity, rural per capita net income, number of livestock per household, input-output ratio, commodity rate of farm produce, and labor productivity were the 01_manuscript factors influencing the health of this eco-economy. Furthermore, this study shows that the eco-economy depends on material input from regions outside the watershed.},

  abstract = {Rainfall kinetic energy (KE) can break down aggregates in the soil surface. A better understanding of sediment sorting associated with various KEs is essential for the development and verification of soil erosion models. A clay loam soil was used in the experiments. Six KEs were obtained (76, 90, 105, 160, 270, and 518J m(-2) h(-1)) by covering wire screens located above the soil surface with different apertures to change the size of raindrops falling on the soil surface, while maintaining the same rainfall intensity (90 +/- 3.5 mm h(-1)). For each rainfall simulation, runoff and sediment were collected at 3-min intervals to investigate the temporal variation of the sediment particle size distribution (PSD). Comparison of the sediment effective PSD (undispersed) and ultimate PSD (dispersed) was used to investigate the detachment and transport mechanisms involved in sediment mobilization. The effective-ultimate ratios of clay-sized particles were less than I, whereas that of sand-sized particles were greater than 1, suggesting that these particles were transported as aggregates. Under higher ICE, the effective-ultimate ratios were much closer to 1, indicating that sediments were more likely transported as primary particles at higher ICE owing to an increased severity of aggregate disaggregation for the clay loam soil. The percentage of clay-sized particles and the relative importance of suspension-saltation increased with increasing ICE when ICE was greater than 105 J m(-2) h(-1), while decreased with increasing ICE when ICE was less than 105 J m(-2) h(-1). A ICE of 105 J m(-2) h(-1) appeared to be a threshold level beyond which the disintegration of aggregates was severe and the influence of ICE on erosion processes and sediment sorting may change. Results of this study demonstrate the need for considering ICE-influenced sediment transport when predicting erosion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Over the past 60 years, climate change and human activities in the Huanghe (Yellow River) basin have changed the river system. In particular, construction of large reservoirs and soil-conservation practices within the river basin have reduced sediment flux to the sea by similar to 90\% and increased the grain size of suspended sediment delivered to the sea (30 mu m now versus 18 mu m before in median grain size). Scouring of the channel in the lower reaches has added a new sediment source to those derived from the loess region of the middle reaches. Before construction of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir at the downstream end of the middle reaches, suspended sediment concentrations at station Lijin, the last hydrographic station before the river enters the sea, were high enough ({$>$}35 kg/m(3)) in the flood season to offset the density contrast between freshwater and ambient seawater. Thus, hyperpycnal flows developed along the subaqueous slope at the river mouth during the flood season. Observations from two cruises near the Huanghe river mouth, one before and one after the operations of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, suggest that buoyant hypopycnal plumes, rather than hyperpycnal plumes, have occurred at the river mouth since the dramatic changes in concentration and grain size of suspended sediment discharged to the sea. The rapid decrease of sediment discharge to the sea and the increase of grain size of suspended sediments not only changed the sediment dispersal pattern at the river mouth, but also modified the shoreline and subaqueous slope. The effects of climate change and human activities in the river basin have been transferred along the hydrological pathway to the estuary and delta, and have changed estuarine sediment dynamics and delta morphology. The Huanghe presents an illustrative example of river basin-coastal zone interactions in the context of climate change and human activities. (c) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Runoff and sediment loads have exhibited significant changes over the past six decades in the Yellow River Basin, China. The current study evaluates the changing trends and regime shifts in runoff and sediment loads at both the annual and monthly time scales. The associated spatial and temporal variations are analyzed by a sequential t-test analysis of the regime shifts (STARS) approach and the "breaks for additive seasonal and trend" (BFAST) model using hydrological data at eight stations from the 1950s to 2011. Both runoff and sediment loads exhibit significant declines (p {$<$} 0.05), except in the upper reaches of the river near the Tangnaihai station. The regime shifts detected by the STARS approach are not completely consistent with the results from the BFAST method. In most cases, the regime shifts occurred in 1969 and 1986, due to the construction of large reservoirs. Climate change and other human activities, such as large-scale soil and water conservation measures, can result in abrupt changes in hydrological series at some stations. The trapping effects of reservoirs not only cause regime shifts of runoff and sediment loads, but also adjust their inter-annual and seasonal distributions. Various soil and water conservation measures are responsible for the significant reduction in runoff and sediment loads in the mid-lower reaches of the Yellow River Basin. In addition, water withdrawals from both river runoff and ground water play a critical role in the changing trends in runoff and indirectly alter the sediment loads. The findings provide a good reference for the effective promotion of climate change adaptation, water resources planning and river basin management.},

Observations in TP have revealed warming and moistening trends before 2004 and weakening of those trends after 2004. These changes in the course of climate warming altered hydrological components in TP from the early years of 1992-2003 to the recent decade of 2004-2015, resulting in strong changes of the terrestrial water storage (TWS) in TP. In this study, hydrological and climatic data that determine the budget of TWS in TP were compiled from multiple data sources for 1992-2015. An empirical formula was developed by correlation analysis of TWS from these data with TWS derived from GRACE data for 2003-2015 in TP. The estimated TWS by the formula highly agrees with GRACE data in describing TWS variations across TP, even though it underestimates the absolute value of annual TWS in north TP. The formula was used to estimate TWS variations in 1992-2003, which were compared to those in 2004-2015.

The reduction of TWS in south TP, with decrease of streamflow and groundwater storage, could threaten the sustainability of surface and subsurface water resources for this critical source region of Asia's large rivers.

Hydrological simulation is an important approach to studying climate change impacts. In this paper, a snowmelt-based water balance model (SWBM) was used to simulate the effect of climate change on runoff in the Kuye River catchment of the Loess Plateau, China. Results indicated that the SWBM is suitable for simulating monthly discharge into arid catchments. The response of runoff in the Kuye River catchment to climate change is nonlinear, and runoff is more sensitive to changes in precipitation than to changes in temperature. The projections indicated that the Kuye River catchment would undergo more flooding in the 2020s, and global warming would probably shorten the 01_manuscript flood season in the catchment, with greater discharge occurring in August. Although projected changes in annual runoff are uncertain, the possibilities of regional water shortages and regional flooding are essential issues that need to be fully considered.},

  abstract = {Evaluating the effects of soil and water conservation on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) during the past 60 years depends mainly on understanding the historical processes of soil erosion fluxes and their mechanism. However, little was known about the historical variation in soil erosion and its driving factors due to the lack of few ideal geological carriers on the CLP. A representative Heshui (HS) landslide-dammed reservoir that formed 200 years ago was drilled with a 31.39 m length sediment sequence. The HS sequence was composed of 165 deposition couplets with 56 annual freeze-thaw layers based on the elemental distributions by X-ray fluorescence core scanners. Mean couplet and annual specific sediment yields (CSSY and ASSY) were 1.44 x 10(4) t/km(2) and 1.28 x 10(4) t/km(2)/yr, respectively. The HS sequence was deposited over CE 1811-1996, which was dated by multi-methods crossing among Cs-137 activities, annual freeze-thaw layers, CSSY, recent rainfall records, and historical flood index grades. Besides, the threshold value of hydrological events that generated sediments in the HS reservoir was greater than 40 mm. As a result, there were eight periods of high ASSY between CE 1811 and 1996, although the total tendency of the ASSY was decreased, especially under the management of soil and water since the 1960s on the CLP. Interannual change of monsoon storms under El Nino-Southern Oscillation events was the primary factor affecting the variations in ASSY and storms in the HS region. Besides, human activities, such as policies and wars, also had significant influences on the historical soil erosion processes in this region. These results not only shed light on the historical changes in soil erosion fluxes and corresponding hydrological events during the past 200 years in the plateau-gully area of the CLP, but the active mechanisms under the different driving factors were also better understood.},

  abstract = {The suspended sediment deposition (SSD) in the alluvial reach between the Qingtongxia station and the Toudaoguai station of the upper Yellow River has shown a dramatic variation since 1952. However, its spatial and temporal changing pattern and driving factors are still not clear. This paper examines the detailed spatial and temporal variations of the SSD based on the annual suspended sediment load at five gaging stations located in this alluvial reach in 1952-2007. The mean annual SSDs in four sub-reaches (Qingtongxia-Shizuishan, Shizuishan-Bayangaole, Bayangaole-Sanhuhekou, and Sanhuhekou-Toudaoguai) were calculated and analyzed for different periods. The mean annual kilometric SSDs in 1952-2007 were -0.228*10(5), 0.97*10(5), 0.165*10(5) and 0.006*10(5) t a(-1) km(-1) in the four sub-reaches, respectively, with the highest SSD occurred in the Shizuishan-Bayangaole sub-reach. Results also suggested that SSD was mainly accumulated in 1952-1959 before major reservoirs were constructed and in 1986-2007 after three major reservoirs (Qingtongxia. Liujiaxia and Longyangxia) were constructed in the 01_manuscript stream. During 1960-1985, all sub-reaches except the Shizuishan-Bayangaole sub-reach experienced channel erosion. Although climate change may play some roles, the changes in SSD were mainly influenced by human activities. In particular, the water and soil conservation actions, such as the construction of check dams from 1958 in upper stream tributaries, intercepted significant amount of suspended sediment and cause the net erosion of the 01_manuscript channel in the 1960s. The operation of the Qingtongxia reservoir reduced the SSD in this downstream reach in the 1970s and 1980s because upper stream suspended sediment was trapped by the reservoir and reservoir-released relative clear water scoured the downstream channel. Although the Liujiaxia and Longyangxia reservoirs trapped relatively small amount of suspended sediment, they stored a large amount of water during the flood season, reducing the discharge and the erosion capability of the downstream flow. Therefore, this operation mode may increase the SSD in this river reach. In addition, with the gradual loss of the Qingtongxia reservoir's capacity in sediment storage, more suspended sediment was released to the downstream channel, causing strong SSD in this reach after 1990.

The water balance and the hydrological cycle are significantly important for vegetation restoration in water-limited regions, and these dynamics are still poorly understood. In this study, the soil moisture and water balance were modelled with the stochastic soil water balance model in the Loess Plateau, China. This model was verified by monitoring soil moisture data of black locust plantations in the Yangjuangou catchment in the Loess Plateau. The influences of a rainfall regime change on soil moisture and water balance were also explored. Three meteorological stations were selected (Yulin, Yan'an, and Luochuan) along the precipitation gradient to detect the effects of rainfall spatial variability on the soil moisture and water balance. The results showed that soil moisture tended to be more frequent at low levels with decreasing precipitation, and the ratio of evapotranspiration under stress in response to rainfall also changed from 74.0\% in Yulin to 52.3\% in Luochuan. In addition, the effects of a temporal change in rainfall regime on soil moisture and water balance were explored at Yan'an. The soil moisture probability density function moved to high soil moisture in the wet period compared to the dry period of Yan'an, and the evapotranspiration under stress increased from 59.5\% to 72\% from the wet period to the dry period. The results of this study prove the applicability of the stochastic model in the Loess Plateau and reveal its potential for guiding the vegetation restoration in the next stage.},

However, few studies have been carried out to quantify the effects of BSCs on temporal variations of soil infiltration properties. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of two typical BSC (moss and cyanobacteria) on the temporal variations of soil infiltration properties reflected by soil sorptivities under different pressures of 0 (S-0) and - 3 (S-3) cm, saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), and wetting front depth (WFD) on the Loess Plateau. Two BSC-covered sites and one bare soil site (as control) were selected to measure soil infiltration properties using a disc infiltrometer under two consecutive pressure heads of 0 and 3 cm, and then the S-0, S-3, and K-s were calculated. The WFD was measured quickly by a ruler after the measurement of soil infiltration. The experiments started from May 9 to October 8, 2015 for 7 times at approximately 3 weeks interval. Soil physicochemical properties and BSC thickness were also measured to explain the temporal variations of soil infiltration properties. The results showed that the thickness of moss and cyanobacteria crusts increased continually during the experimental period. BSC affected top-soil (0-5 cm) properties (soil water content, bulk density, texture, and organic matter content) significantly, and the effects of moss were greater than those of cyanobacteria. BSC was effective to impede soil infiltration. Compared to the control, the mean S-0, S-3, K-s, and WFD of moss-covered soil reduced by 31.4\%, 25.2\%, 39.0\%, and 22.7\%. While, S-0, S-3, K-s and WFD of cyanobacteria-covered soil declined by 21.5\%, 18.2\%, 29.3\%, and 11.9\%, respectively. The temporal variations in infiltration properties of both moss- and cyanobacteria-covered soils were similar. S-0, S-3, K-s, and WFD generally decreased over time. However, the related infiltration properties of bare soil fluctuated over time with no distinguish trend. The temporal variations in infiltration properties were closely related to the seasonal variations in BSC thickness and soil water content.},

The Yellow River water allocation scheme (Scheme 1987 in short) was approved in 1987 by the State Council, which was the first river water allocation scheme in China. It allocates a total volume of 58 billion m\textsuperscript{3{$<$}sup/{$>$} of water to the 11 provinces along the river and its ecosystem. However, with the deepening impact of climate change and human activities, the Yellow River water resource and its development situations have some changes and the water resource of the drainage basin faces new situations, so it is urgent to carry out the optimization and adjustment study of Scheme 1987 under the new situation. The background and promulgation process of Scheme 1987 was reviewed comprehensively, and its implementation effect for 30 years was analyzed from two periods before and after unified dispatching. The new situation of the development of the Yellow River basin in the future was analyzed, and the work to be carried out to optimize and adjust the Scheme 1987 was prospected.}},

  abstract = {Few hyperpycnal flows have ever been observed in marine environments although they are believed to play a critical role in sediment dispersal within estuarine and deltaic depositional systems. The paper describes hyperpycnal flows observed in situ off the Huanghe (Yellow River) mouth, their relationship to tidal cycles, and the mechanisms that drive them. Simultaneous observations at six mooring stations during a cruise off the Huanghe mouth in the flood season of 1995 suggest that hyperpycnal flows observed at the river mouth are initiated by high concentrations of sediment input from river and modulated by tides. Hyperpycnal flows started near the end of ebb tides, when near-bottom suspended sediment concentration (SSC) increased rapidly and salinity decreased drastically (an inverse salt wedge). The median grain size of suspended particles within the hyperpycnal layer increased, causing strong stratification of the suspended sediments in the water column. Towards the end of flood tides, the hyperpycnal flow attenuated due to frictions at the upper and lower boundaries of the flow and tidal mixing, which collapsed the stratification of the water column. Both sediment concentration and median grain size of suspended particles within the bottom layer significantly decreased. The coarser sediment particles were deposited and the hyperpycnal flows stopped. The intra-tidal behaviors of hyperpycnal flows are closely associated with the variations of SSC, salinity, and stratification of the water column. As nearly 90\% of riverine sediment is delivered to the sea during the flood seasons when hyperpycnal flows are active, hyperpycnal flows at the Huanghe mouth and the river's high sediment loads have caused rapid accretion of the Huanghe delta.

The objective was to test different conservation tillage systems compared with the control treatment, conventional mouldboard plough practice (CK). Tillage, residue cover, and compaction effects were assessed in terms of runoff and soil erosion. Results from the runoff plots showed that conservation tillage, with more residue cover, less compaction, and less soil disturbance, could substantially reduce runoff and soil erosion compared with the control. No tillage with residue cover and no compaction produced the least runoff and soil erosion. Compared with the control, it reduced runoff and soil erosion by about 40\% and 80\%, respectively. At the start of the experiment, residue cover appeared to be the most important factor affecting soil and water conservation, particularly when antecedent soil moisture was limited. With the accumulation of tractor wheeling effects over the course of the experiment, soil compaction appeared to become a more important factor affecting runoff. Rainfall simulation was then used to assess the effect of non-inverting surface tillage and different levels of residue cover and wheel compaction on in filtration and runoff. This confirmed that wheel compaction effects could be greater than those of tillage and residue cover, at least under the 82.5 mm/h rainfall rate produced by the simulator. The wheeling effect was particularly large when the treatment was applied to wet soil, and severe even after wheeling by small tractors.},

In this context, this paper aims to develop a conceptual framework for understanding the human-water system from the contradiction and co-evolutionary perspective. In this paper, the three contradiction relationships including those of human-water system, climate change and war condition, productive forces and production relations are analyzed by choosing six proxy indicators, and a set of historical data during 722~B.C.-1911~A.D., in China is used as the case study. Human and water is a co-evolution system as the coefficient of determination (R2) between population and water governance activities is 0.9. Advanced productive forces and production relations play an important role in promoting population growth and water governance activities evidenced by high R2 between any two of them. Generally, the co-evolutionary process of these three contradictions can be divided into three stages: slow development, moderate development and fast development. The conceptual framework developed in this study can be used to analyze the evolution of similar human-water systems in the world. Moreover, further research should be done through the simulation of the form and cycles of the three contradiction relationships.},

  abstract = {With the change of climate and the impacts of human activities, the water resources crisis of the Yellow River is becoming increasingly serious. How and why did the streamflows of the Yellow River basin change? Based on observed annual runoff data (1956-2016) of 10 01_manuscript hydrological stations along the Yellow River, the linear regression method, the Spearman rank correlation method and the Mann-Kendall test method are used to analyze runoff trend. The orderly clustering method, the sliding t test method and the Lee-Heghinian Method are used to identify the abrupt change point. Finally, the wavelet analysis method is used to identify runoff time series period. The results show that: (1) With the exception of the streamflow of Tangnaihai, the streamflows of all examined stations have significantly declining trends. The decrease of the streamflow from the upper to the middle to the lower reaches is becoming more and more obvious; (2) The runoff of the Yellow River has changed greatly. The abrupt change point at Tangnaihai occurred in 1989. The abrupt change points of the other stations took place in 1985; (3) The runoff along the Yellow River presents multi-time scale changes. The streamflows appear to have strongest periods of 25-40 years with a 40-year scale, which indicate the alternate oscillations of the high and the low water periods. The periods of {$<$}6 and 7-24 years are not stable and are complicated. The first 01_manuscript period of runoff in the Yellow River is 30 years; (4) The streamflow upstream of Tangnaihai station is mainly affected by the climate. The streamflows downstream of Tangnaihai station are influenced by human activities, especially water extraction and diversion and the operations of the large reservoirs. These research results have important practical guiding significance for hydrological forecasting, evaluation and management of water resources, construction of water conservancy projects and sustainable utilization of water resources in the region.},

TheYellow River has undergone a dramatic shift during the last six decades. Its streamflow gradually dwindled away and even dried-up severely in the late 20th century, but in recent years it has recovered and remains stable. Comprehensive understanding of the river streamflow change and its driving forces promotes effective water resource management within this complex human-natural system. Here, we develop a runoff identity attribution approach to analyze 61 years of streamflow observations from the Yellow River. We find that between the 1950s and the 1980s, human water consumption contributed more than 90\% to streamflow reduction, but from the 1970s onwards, land cover change became the major factor to decrease streamflow. Since 2000, government management schemes have prevented streamflow from declining further and guarantee its stability. Based on the analysis framework we propose, persistent droughts, which are related to abrupt streamflow abatement, may be the most uncontrollable factor in the future. A more resilient management system should be therefore built to grapple with the expected increased frequency of such extreme climate events in the future.},

Frozen ground ranges from seasonally frozen ground (SFG) to sporadic discontinuous permafrost (SDP) to extensive discontinuous permafrost (EDP), and is representative of complex conditions in the Source Area of the Yellow River, northeastern part of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Radioactive and stable water isotopes in reference lakes (non-thaw lakes), thermokarst lakes, precipitation, wetlands, ground ice and supra permafrost groundwater are analyzed to characterize systematic variations and to assess lake water balances using stable isotope mass balance (IMB). IMB, paired with analysis of tritium decay gradients, is shown to be a valid approach for detecting short-term shifts in lake water balance, which allows evaluation of the proportion of precipitation-derived versus permafrost-derived water inputs to lakes. All lakes except EDP thaw lakes are evaporation-dominated (E/I {$>$} 0.5). Negative water balances occurred most frequently in reference lakes due to hydrological connectivity with rivers. Precipitation-derived water inputs result in positive water balances in SFG and SDP thermokarst lakes, but negative-trending water balances arc found in SDP thermokarst lakes clue to substantial reduction in water yield Increasing contributions from thawing permafrost in EDP thermokarst lakes result in strong positive water balance. Permafrost degradation may also lead to the changes in hydrological connectivity between precipitation and wetlands or thermokarst lakes. Based on these findings, a conceptual model of the hydrological evolution of thermokarst lakes under the influence of permafrost degradation is proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, the influences of the coupled effects of upslope topography and vegetation cover on flow accumulation and the downslope soil erosion are not fully considered in the current methods. In this study, a new calculating method for slope length factor (L), named the modified grid formula based on upslope contributing areas (L-M), was established by adding a new parameter, the effective contributing area ratio, to the existing L calculating method, the grid formula based on upslope contributing areas (L-G). A small watershed on the Loess Plateau was selected to evaluate the effects of the L-M on watershed soil erosion assessment. The soil erosion was estimated via the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation using with two L calculating methods: L-M and L-G. Then, the soil loss of various land use types estimated from the two L methods were compared with the corresponding observed values from the nearby runoff plots, and the sediment yields based on the two L methods were estimated using the Sediment Delivery Distributed model and compared with measured values at the hydrologic station in the outlet of the watershed. The results indicated that, compared with L-G, 1) the L values obtained via the L-M were lower, contributing to a substantial decrease in soil erosion estimated at the watershed scale; 2) the average annual soil erosion estimated via the L-M for slope farmland, forestland and grassland in the watershed were closer to the observed values from local runoff plots; 3) the average annual sediment yield of the watershed estimated via the L-M was only +/- 5\% relative to the measured values, implying that the values estimated via L-M was more accurate than the current methods. Overall, the L-M has accounted for the effect of vegetation hydrologic process and erosion process, which can improve the estimation accuracy of soil erosion assessments at the watershed scales and limit the risk of overestimating.},

  abstract = {The sustainability of human water use practices is a rapidly growing concern in the United States and around the world. To better characterize direct human interaction with hydrologic systems (stream basins and aquifers), we introduce the concept of the water use regime. Unlike scalar indicators of anthropogenic hydrologic stress in the literature, the water use regime is a two-dimensional, vector indicator that can be depicted on simple x-y plots of normalized human withdrawals (hout) versus normalized human return flows (hin). Four end-member regimes, natural-flow-dominated (undeveloped), human-flow-dominated (churned), withdrawal-dominated (depleted), and return-flow-dominated (surcharged), are defined in relation to limiting values of hout and hin. For illustration, the water use regimes of 19 diverse hydrologic systems are plotted and interpreted. Several of these systems, including the Yellow River Basin, China, and the California Central Valley Aquifer, are shown to approach particular end-member regimes. Spatial and temporal regime variations, both seasonal and long-term, are depicted. Practical issues of data availability and regime uncertainty are addressed in relation to the statistical properties of the ratio estimators hout and hin. The water use regime is shown to be a useful tool for comparative water resources assessment and for describing both historic and alternative future pathways of water resource development at a range of scales.},

  abstract = {As one of the most intensively eroded regions worldwide, soil erosion assessment is currently gaining further momentum in the Loess Plateau (LP), China. However, there exist very few review studies that assess soil erosion in relation to land use and land cover (LULC), climate, and ecosystem services (ESs) at multiple temporal and spatial scales in the LP. Thus, this review provides a comprehensive review of the interactions among soil erosion assessment, climate change, LULC change, and ESs at different scales. We focused on the academic literature published in the English language and analyzed the coverage of soil erosion across 109 publications. Our results highlighted three aspects: (1) studies dealing with the effects of LULC change on soil erosion are abundant. A recent surge in research interest is to explore a threshold of vegetation cover to support a sustainable eco-hydrological environment in the LP. However, the impacts of multiple stressors on soil erosion have received limited attention. (2) The short-term soil erosion assessment dominated the published studies. Cross-spatial-scale and long-term erosion assessments have received little attention. (3) 43\% of reviewed papers used a field measurement method to assess soil erosion with the validation of measurement methods. 41\% of reviewed papers used empirical models to assess soil erosion, but the modeling validation remains an unsolved problem. Then, three recommendations are listed as follows: (1) the combined impacts of LULC and climate change on soil erosion need to be further examined. (2) Long-term and cross-spatial-scale soil erosion assessments need to be established. (3) Soil erosion modeling accuracy on a large scale needs to be developed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The exact relationship between people's climate change attitudes and behaviour is a topic that engages policymakers and researchers worldwide. Do climate change attitudes influence behaviour or is it possible that behaviour can change attitudes? This study uses a unique repeated survey dataset of 275 farmers (irrigators) in the southern Murray-Darling Basin from 2010\textendash 11 to 2015\textendash 16, to explore the dynamic relationship between climate change risk perceptions and farm adaptation behaviour. Farmers who had an increased risk exposure (expressed through higher debt, larger irrigated areas, greater share of permanent crops, and located in areas with higher temperatures and less rainfall) were more likely to agree climate change posed a risk. Whilst farmers became more accepting towards climate change over the time-period, a significant percentage of these attitudes were unstable. One reason suggested for this instability is the presence of a feedback loop between risk per\- ceptions and behaviour. Namely, new evidence was found that farmers who agreed climate change was a risk in 2010\textendash 11, were more likely to undertake farm production decisions to reduce that risk (e.g. changing crop mix, reducing irrigated area and consequently selling water entitlements) \textendash{} which had the impact of negatively feeding back and reducing their stated climate change risk perceptions in 2015\textendash 16. Conversely, farmers who were originally deniers were more likely to undertake somewhat riskier farm production decisions (e.g. increasing water utilisation rates and irrigation areas) \textendash{} which consequently had the impact of positively increasing their climate change risk perceptions in 2015\textendash 16.},

Environmental Transformations offers a concise and accessible introduction to the human practices and systems that sustain the Anthropocene. It combines accounts of the carbon cycle, global heat balances, entropy, hydrology, forest ecology, and pedology, with theories of demography, war, industrial capitalism, urban development, state theory, and behavioural psychology. This book charts the particular role of geography and geographers in studying environmental change and its human drivers.

Fast ecological responses closely track climate change, slow responses substantively lag climate forcing, causing disequilibria and reduced fitness, and abrupt responses are characterized by nonlinear, threshold-type responses at rates that are large relative to background variability and forcing. All three kinds of climate-driven ecological dynamics are well documented in contemporary studies, palaeoecology and invasion biology. This fast\textendash slow\textendash abrupt conceptual framework helps unify a bifurcated climate-change literature, which tends to separately consider the ecological risks posed by slow or abrupt ecological dynamics. Given the prospect of ongoing climate change for the next several decades to centuries of the Anthropocene and wide variations in ecological rates of change, the theory and practice of managing ecological systems should shift attention from target states to target rates. A rates-focused framework broadens the strategic menu for managers to include options to both slow and accelerate ecological rates of change, seeks to reduce mismatch among climate and ecological rates of change, and provides a unified conceptual framework for tackling the distinct risks associated with fast, slow and abrupt ecological rates of change.},

Existing global flood risk projections fail to integrate the combined dynamics of expected socio-economic development and climate change. We present the first global future river flood risk projections that separate the impacts of climate change and socio-economic development. The projections are based on an ensemble of climate model outputs(2), socio-economic scenarios(3), and a state-of-the-art hydrologic river flood model combined with socio-economic impact models(4,5). Globally, absolute damage may increase by up to a factor of 20 by the end of the century without action. Countries in Southeast Asia face a severe increase in flood risk. Although climate change contributes significantly to the increase in risk in Southeast Asia(6), we show that it is dwarfed by the effect of socio-economic growth, even after normalization for gross domestic product (GDP) growth. African countries face a strong increase in risk mainly due to socio-economic change. However, when normalized to GDP, climate change becomes by far the strongest driver. Both high-and low-income countries may benefit greatly from investing in adaptation measures, for which our analysis provides a basis.},

Major land policies have recently resulted in remarkable landscape modifications throughout the basin. The availability of precise regional land cover change information is crucial to better understand the prevailing dynamics and underlying factors influencing the current processes in such a complex system and can additionally serve as a valuable component for modeling and decision making. Such comprehensive and detailed information is lacking for the Yellow River Basin so far. In this study, we derived land cover characteristics and dynamics from the complete last decade based on optical high-temporal MODIS Normalized Differenced Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series for the whole Yellow River Basin. After filtering and smoothing for noise reduction with the use of the adaptive Savitzky-Golay filter, the processed time series was used to derive a large variety of phenological and annual metrics. The final classifications for the basin (2003 and 2013) were based on a random forest classifier, trained by reference samples from very high-resolution imagery. The accuracy assessment for all 18 thematic classes, which was based on a 30\% reference data split, yielded an overall accuracy of 87\% and 84\% for 2003 and 2013, respectively. Major land cover and land use changes during the last decade have occurred on the Loess Plateau, where land and conservation reforms triggered large-scale recovery of grassland and shrubland habitat that had been previously covered by agriculture or sparse vegetation. Agricultural encroachment and urban area expansion are other processes influencing the dynamics in the basin. The necessity for regionally-adapted land cover maps becomes obvious when our land cover products are compared to existing global products, where thematic accuracy remains low, particularly in a heterogeneous landscape, such as the Yellow River Basin. The basin-wide novel land cover and land use products of the Yellow River Basin hold a large potential for climate, hydrology and biodiversity modelers, as well as river basin and regional governmental authorities and will be shared upon request.},

In recent decades, the Yellow River basin is facing a spectacular economic boom, but mainly achieved at the expenses of the environment by over-exploiting the natural resources provided within the basin, which causes various challenges on ecology and society. Water scarcity, pollution, and ecosystem degradation accompanied with biodiversity decline have been further aggravated by anthropogenic-induced climate change.

  abstract = {{$<$}p indent=0mm{$>$}Agriculture is the sector with the largest water usage globally, as well as within China. Water is a limited resource that represents the base for regional food security. Modern water science has revealed that crop production consumes not only so-called blue water (surface and ground water), which is at the core of current agricultural water policies, but also so-called green water (rainwater). As driven by natural-socio-economic (``ternary'') activities, water related to the crop production chain (i.e. pre-, during- and after-production) flows in coupled physical and virtual (the ``two-dimension'') forms through physical water consumption, virtual water embedding and inter-regional virtual water flows. In this work, based on a physical-virtual water flow theory framework, we have developed a quantification approach for regional crop-related physical-virtual water flow processes, with a focus on the water quantity. This quantification integrates green and blue water footprint accounting and virtual water flow network simulations. We applied this approach in a case study for six western provinces along the ``Silk Road Economic Belt'' in China over the period 1985-2013. Ten major crops were considered in the case study. Our results show significant crop-related physical-virtual water flows among the six provinces. In terms of blue water, 49\% of the irrigation water supply was consumed in the crop production we considered, 31\% of which was converted to virtual water flows. Moreover, we find that a trade-off exists between water use efficiency and associated economic value along the physical-virtual water flows. For example, Xinjiang has suffered water stress due to crop production, with a net virtual water export of \textsc{21\texttimes 10\textsuperscript{9} m\textsuperscript{3}/a,} but has a high economic income of 314 million CNY/a as a result of the water flow. This study highlights the importance and necessity of improving traditional agricultural water management, which focuses on reducing blue water consumption through engineering strategies, by integrating physical-virtual water flow assessments in order to achieve both high resources and economic efficiencies in water use, as well as both green and blue water savings. Specifically, we propose three key steps towards attaining this goal: (1) To consider both the physical and virtual water flows in modern agriculture water saving technologies as well as policies; (2) to invest in and enhance academic capabilities for quantifying, analysing and optimizing agricultural physical-virtual water flows; (3) to build a modern agricultural water management system targeted towards healthy and sustainable physical-virtual water flows in order to finally achieve both water sustainability and food security goals.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The pulsed events of rainstorm erosion on the Loess Plateau are well-known, but little information is available concerning the characteristics of superficial soil erosion processes caused by heavy rainstorms at the watershed scale. This study statistically evaluated characteristics of pulsed runoff-erosion events based on 17 observed rainstorms from 1997-2010 in a small loess watershed on the Loess Plateau of China. Results show that: 1) Rainfall is the fundamental driving force of soil erosion on hillslopes, but the correlations of rainfall-runoff and rainfall-sediment in different rainstorms are often scattered due to infiltration-excess runoff and soil conservation measures. 2) Relationships between runoff and sediment for each rainstorm event can be regressed by linear, power, logarithmic and exponential functions. Cluster Analysis is helpful in classifying runoff-erosion events and formulating soil conservation strategies for rainstorm erosion. 3) Response characteristics of sediment yield are different in different levels of pulsed runoff-erosion events. Affected by rainfall intensity and duration, large changes may occur in the interactions between flow and sediment for different flood events. Results provide new insights into runoff-erosion processes and will assist soil conservation planning in the loess hilly region.},

  abstract = {Climate change has effects on hydrological change in multiple aspects, particularly in the headwaters of the Yellow River (HWYR), which is widely covered by climate-sensitive frozen ground. In this study, the annual runoff was partitioned into four runoff compositions: winter baseflow, snowmelt runoff, rainy season runoff, and recession flow. In addition, the effects of global warming, precipitation change, and frozen ground degradation were considered in long-term variation analyses of the runoff compositions. The moving t-test was employed to detect change points of the hydrometeorological data series from 1961 to 2013, and flow duration curves were used to analyze daily runoff regime change in different periods. It was found that the abrupt change points of cold season runoff, such as recession flow, winter baseflow, and snowmelt runoff, are different from that of the rainy season runoff. The increase in winter baseflow and decrease in snowmelt runoff at the end of 1990s was closely related to global warming. In the 21st century, winter baseflow presented a larger relative increase compared to rainy season runoff. The correlation analyses indicate that winter baseflow and snowmelt runoff are mainly controlled by water-resource-related factors, such as rainy season runoff and the accumulated precipitation in cold season. To analyze the global warming impacts, two runoff coefficients winter baseflow discharge rate (R-w) and direct snowmelt runoff coefficients (R-s) were proposed, and their correlation with freezing-thawing indices were analyzed. The increase of R-w is related to the increase in the air temperature thawing index (DDT), but R-s is mainly controlled by the air temperature freezing index (DDF). Meanwhile, the direct snowmelt runoff coefficient (R-s) is significantly and positively correlated to DDF and has decreased at a rate of 0.0011/year since 1980. Under global warming, the direct snowmelt runoff (runoff increment between March to May) of the HWYR could decrease continuously in the future due to the decrease of accumulative snow in cold season and frozen ground degradation. This study provides a better understanding of the long-term runoff characteristic changes in the HWYR.},

Here we reconstructed changes of sediment discharge in the Yellow River over the last 7000\,years based on a large number of 14C dates obtained from literature and discussed the impact of climate change and human activities from the mid-Holocene to the Anthropocene. From 7000 to about 3000\,cal\,yr\,BP, the Yellow River's sediment discharge was lower than 0.09\,gigatonnes per year (Gt/yr). Due to low population and limited ability to conquer nature, climatic conditions almost completely controlled the sediment discharge over this period. After 3000\,cal\,yr\,BP, the sediment discharge increased gently to 0.23\,Gt/yr at 1400\,cal\,yr\,BP. Since then, the sediment discharge increased abruptly to 1.56\,Gt/yr in 1855\,CE and subsequently remained at a fairly high level of 1.31\,Gt/yr with fluctuations for nearly a century. Human activities gradually enhanced the increasing trend of sediment discharge and began to affect the environment at a scale comparable with powerful natural forcing due to population growth and technique innovation. Since the late 1950s, the terrestrial sediment from the Yellow River to the sea has experienced a cliff-like drop, which appears to be reverting to the pristine levels of the middle Holocene. With the explosive growth of the population, technological innovation and economic development, human activities in the drainage basin intensified continuously and greatly regulated the water and land resources.},

However, causal evidence of countries' influence is scarce. Using global geospatial datasets and a regression discontinuity design, we provide causal quantifications of the way crop yield gaps, nitrogen pollution and nitrogen pollution per crop yield are influenced by country-level factors, such as institutions and policies. We find that countries influence nitrogen pollution much more than crop yields and there is only a small trade-off between reducing nitrogen pollution and increasing yields. Overall, countries that cause 35\% less nitrogen pollution than their neighbours only show a 1\% larger yield gap (the difference between attainable and attained yields). Explanations of which countries cause the most pollution relative to their crop yields include economic development, population size, institutional quality and foreign financial flows to land resources, as well as countries' overall agricultural intensity and share in the economy. Our findings suggest that many national governments have an impressive capacity to reduce global nitrogen pollution without having to sacrifice much agricultural production.},

The applicability of this approach has been demonstrated by analyzing the evolution over the past 1000 years of the SES in China's Loess Plateau (LP). Five evolutionary phases were identified: "fast expansion of cultivation," "slow expansion of cultivation," "landscape engineering for higher production," "transition from cultivation to ecological conservation," and "revegetation for environment." Our study establishes empirical links between the state (phase) of a SES to its drivers and effects. Lessons of single-goal driven and locally focused SES management in the LP, which did not consider these links, have important implications to long-term planning and policy formulation of SES.},

  abstract = {The promise of big data is enormous and nowhere is it more critical than in its potential to contain important, undiscovered interdependence among thousands of variables. Networks have arisen as a powerful tool to detect how different variables are interconnected and how these interconnections mediate the internal workings and dynamics of various physical, chemical, biological, and social systems. Although a number of statistical methods have been developed for network reconstruction, the use of networks to excavate useful information from complex big data poses a conceptual, technical, and computational challenge. Here, we describe recent advances in statistical formalism that can recover mechanistically interpretable and practically applicable networks from wide big data domains. Traditional approaches can only infer an overall network from a number of samples, failing to reveal sample-specific differences. Identifying meaningful networks particularly requires the availability of high-density temporal or perturbed data and their dynamic fitting over time, both of which are hardly met in most big data sectors. The new formalism can particularly extract and tap dynamic information hidden in static data to reconstruct mobile networks without need of temporal data and, thereby, track how topological architecture changes from sample to sample and across time and space scales. We review the establishment principle of this new formalism derived from the seamless integration of ingredients of various disciplines, such as allometric scaling laws, evolutionary game theory, and developmental modularity theory. We show how this formalism can infer fully informative networks, encapsulated by bidirectional, signed, and weighted pairwise and high-order interactions, overcoming the intrinsic limitation of static data for network identification. We propose a general framework to augment a generalized argument for inferring omnidirectional, multilayer, and multispace networks from any high dimension of data and fill gaps in network reconstruction between standard techniques and the current state of the art. This formalism represents a paradigm shifting emerging technology that can make sophisticated networks a more efficient, effective and widespread tool to disentangle natural complexities in the era of big data.},

Hydrographic surveys conducted simultaneously at stations along three transects off the river mouth during the WSRS in 2013 were used to investigate the dispersal and accumulation of the Huanghe sediment off the present Huanghe subaqueous delta. During the WSRS period, the diluted water from the river covered all over the study area within the surface layer, whereas high-concentrated sediment was found in the bottom layers and to be limited in nearshore area shallower than 12 m, indicating that the buoyant river plume was the 01_manuscript sediment dispersal pattern during the WSRS. At the early stage of the WSRS when large amount of clear water was released from the Xiaolangdi Reservoir, sediment eroded from the downstream riverbed in the lower reaches increased the median grain size of surface sediment at the river mouth. During the second stage when water discharge was reduced but sediment discharge was dramatically increased, the fine-grained sediment derived from the Xiaolangdi Reservoir mixed with the previously deposited coarser surface sediment, leading to the decreasing median grain size of surface sediment that approached to be poorly sorted. After the physical sorting from winter storms, the surface sediment was redistributed and varied regularly with water depth. As the median grain size of suspended sediment discharge to the sea has been significantly increased due to the WSRS, the river-delivered sediment mostly accumulated in the nearshore area, which effectively extended the subaerial delta and steepened the subaqueous slope off the present river mouth.

  abstract = {The presently active Yellow River (Huanghe) delta lobe has been formed since 1976 when the river was artificially diverted. The process and driving forces of morphological evolution of the present delta lobe still remain unclear. Here we examined the stepwise morphological evolution of the active Yellow River delta lobe including both the subaerial and the subaqueous components, and illustrated the critical roles of riverine discharge and sediment grain size in dominating the deltaic evolution. The critical sediment loads for maintaining the delta stability were also calculated from water discharge and sediment load measured at station Lijin, the last gauging station approximately 100 km upstream from the river mouth. The results indicated that the development of active delta lobe including both subaerial and subaqueous components has experienced four sequential stages. During the first stage (1976-1981) after the channel migration, the unchannelized river flow enhanced deposition within the channel and floodplain between Lijin station and the river mouth. Therefore, the critical sediment supply calculated by the river inputs obtained from station Lijin was the highest. However, the actual sediment load at this stage (0.84 Gt/yr) was more than twice of the critical sediment load (similar to 0.35 Gt/yr) for sustaining the active subaerial area, which favored a rapid seaward progradation of the Yellow River subaerial delta. During the second stage (1981-1996), the engineering. facilitated channelized river flow and the increase in median grain size of suspended sediment delivered to the sea resulted in the critical sediment load for keeping the delta stability deceasing to 0.29 Gt/yr. The active delta lobe still gradually prograded seaward at an accretion rate of 11.9 km(2)/yr at this stage as the annual sediment load at Lijin station was 0.55 Gt/yr. From 1996 to 2002, the critical sediment load further decreased to 0.15 Gt/yr with the sediment grain size increased to 22.5 mu m; however, the delta suffered net erosion because of the insufficient sediment supply (0.11 Gt/yr). In the most recent stage (2002 - 2013), the intensive scouring of the lower river channel induced by the dam regulation provided relatively coarser sediment, which effectively reduced the critical sediment load to 0.06 Gt/yr, much lower than the corresponding sediment load at Lijin station (similar to 0.16 Gt/yr). Consequently, the subaerial Yellow River delta transitioned to a slight accretion phase. Overall, the evolution of the active Yellow River delta is highly correlated to riverine water and sediment discharge. The sediment supply for keeping the subaerial delta stability is inconstant and varying with the river channel morphology and sediment grain size. We conclude that the human-impacted riverine sediment discharge and grain-size composition play dominant roles in the stepwise morphological evolution of the active delta lobe.},

  abstract = {Glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) and bulk organic geochemical parameters were examined for a short core from the Bohai Sea, a Yellow River-dominated continental margin. A three end member mixing model using branched/isoprenoid tetraethers (BIT) index, delta C-13 and C/N shows that the average fractions of soil, marine and plant organic matter (OM) during the period of 1933-2011 are 67.7\% (38-92\%), 26.1\% (0-58\%) and 6.2\% (0-23\%), respectively. Abrupt changes of sedimentary OM compositions around 1953, 1976 and 1996 are synchronous with the Yellow River mouth relocations. The BIT index values (0.33-0.80) present a stronger correlation with crenarchaeol abundance (R-2 = 0.88) than branched GDGTs abundance (R-2 = 0.27), suggesting that variations of marine Thaumarchaeota abundance rather than soil OM inputs is the first order factor controlling the BIT index values, although this proxy has been widely used for soil OM. The comparison between the BIT index, nutrient status and historical Yellow River sediment load indicates that the high sensitivity of the BIT index to the Yellow River channel shifts cannot be explained by a nutrient stimulation mechanism, but instead is likely caused by the restriction of Thaumarchaeota growth in highly turbid water due to the enormous sediment inputs from Yellow River. Our study demonstrates that local conditions should be considered when applying the BIT index as an environmental proxy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper aims at a better understanding of the development of the water allocation regime in the Yellow River Basin between 1950 and 2009, introducing a fresh perspective based on the notion of ``regime transition''. Accordingly, we investigated 1) whether so-called ``Windows of Opportunity for Transition (WOPTs)'' emerged, triggering a transition, and whether WOPT(s) resulted in a stable transition towards the new regime; 2) how informal learning processes and epistemic communities have contributed to the regime change. We adapted Kingdon's ``multiple stream model'' and identified four WOPTs from the 1950s, analyzing the reconfiguration process of the regime after the onset of the transition. Our examples of two types of informal learning processes demonstrate their contribution to the creation of WOPTs and the reconfiguration of the regime. Furthermore, this study indicates, in a qualitative manner, how epistemic communities contribute to the knowledge base of the regime, and thus to its development. Finally, we have provided a general insight into the further development of the water allocation regime and highlighted potential avenues for further studies.},

  abstract = {Forest litter layer plays an important role in controlling water and soil loss; however, few studies have examined how litter cover affects hydrological processes. In this research, the effects of forest litter cover on interception, runoff, infiltration and soil erosion were investigated using rainfall simulation on a loess hillslope in China. Field experimental plots (10 m x 1.5 m, 5 degrees) with two litter species (needle-leaf species and broad-leaf species) and three litter masses (300, 500 and 800 g m(-2)) were exposed to two rainfall intensities (30 and 60 mm h(-1)) for 40 min. A modified Merriam interception model as well as a WEPP (Water Erosion Prediction Project) Hillslope model were subsequently employed to analyze the experimental data of litter interception as well as runoff generation and soil erosion, respectively. Results showed that litter interception storage capacity ranged from 0.55 to 2.10 mm; thus, 1.8-9.2\% of total rainfall was intercepted by the litter layer. Interception storage increased with increasing litter mass and rainfall intensity, and broad-leaf litter could intercept more rainwater than needle-leaf litter. Litter cover reduced runoff rates from plots covered with needle-leaf and broad-leaf litter by 18.6\% and 25.9\%, respectively, compared to the bare plot. Although runoff rates were slightly lower in litter-covered plots than in the bare plot, soil loss was effectively controlled when litter mass levels reached a threshold value of SOO g m(-2). Compared to that from the bare plot, the mean soil loss rate for litter-covered plots was lowered by 58.5\%, 74.5\% and 78.3\% for litter masses of 300, 500 and 800 g m(-2) , respectively. These results indicate that the litter layer was more conducive to controlling soil loss than runoff generation. Furthermore, the determination coefficient and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient of the modified Merriam model ranged between 0.838-0.998 and 0.912-0.998, respectively, indicating that this model could successfully simulate the litter interception process. The WEPP model predictions also agreed well with the measured runoff and soil loss rates, but may have under-estimated the measured data in low rainfall intensity events and over-estimated the measured data in high rainfall intensity events. The performance of the WEPP model could be obviously improved by reducing the effective hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility. Overall, this study will enable the development of more accurate modeling approaches and lead to a better understanding of hydrological processes under litter cover conditions.},

Variations in surface runoff and sediment yield because of landuse change in four watersheds of different scales from 1 km(2) to 73 km(2) were analyzed. Due to reforestation and farmland terracing, surface runoff and sediment yield reduced by 20-100\% and 10-100\% respectively. Reductions in surface runoff were differed significantly under different precipitation regimes. For the large watershed (73 km(2)) landuse change had similar effects on surface runoff regardless of changing of precipitation. For the small watershed (1 km(2)) landuse change had fewer effects on surface runoff under high precipitation. The relative changes of sediment yield in the four watersheds under reforestation and farmland terracing decreased as precipitation increased from 350 mm to 650 mm, then increased as precipitation increased from 650 mm to 870 mm. Where initial forest coverage rate was below 45\%, sediment yield decreased dramatically as forest coverage rate increased. Watershed management with aiming at reducing both surface runoff and sediment yield should be conducted both on sloping surfaces and in channels in large watersheds.},

China's central government launched the Grain for Green Program (GGP) in 1999 to increase forest cover and to control soil erosion by converting agricultural lands on steep slopes to forests and grasslands. Here a variety of satellite data products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer were used to assess the biophysical consequences of the GGP for the Loess Plateau, the pilot region of the program. The average tree cover of the plateau substantially increased because of the GGP, with a relative increase of 41.0\%. The GGP led to significant increases in enhanced vegetation index (EVI), leaf area index, and the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by canopies. The increase in forest productivity as approximated by EVI was not driven by elevated air temperature, changing precipitation, or rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Moreover, the afforestation significantly reduced surface albedo, leading to a positive radiative forcing and a warming effect on the climate. The GGP also led to a significant decline in daytime land surface temperature and exerted a cooling effect on the climate. The GGP therefore has significant biophysical consequences by altering carbon cycling, hydrologic processes, and surface energy exchange and has significant feedbacks to the regional climate. The net radiative forcing on the climate depends on the offsetting of the negative forcing from carbon sequestration and higher evapotranspiration and the positive forcing from lower albedo.},

It has found successful applications in all natural and social sciences, including biology, physics, economics, chemistry, astronomy, psychology, and so on. Among various types of algorithms, hierarchical clustering is of particular advantages as it can provide results under different resolutions without the knowledge of a predetermined number of clusters. At the same time, it is usually time-consuming or inaccurate. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical clustering algorithm on the basis of a simple hypothesis that two reciprocal nearest data points should be grouped in one cluster. Extensive tests on data sets across multiple domains show that our method is much faster and more accurate than the state-of-the-art benchmarks. We further extend our method to deal with the community detection problem in real networks, achieving remarkably better results than the well-known Girvan-Newman algorithm.},

In this region, the mass loss caused by coal mining can reach the level of billions of tons per year. For this reason, in this work, in addition to Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravity data and hydrological models, coal mining data were also used to monitor GWS variation in the Loess Plateau during the period of 2005-2014. The GWS changes results from different GRACE solutions, that is, the spherical harmonics (SH) solutions, mascon solutions, and Slepian solutions (which are the Slepian localization of SH solutions), were compared with in situ GWS changes, obtained from 136 groundwater observation wells, and the aim was to acquire the most robust GWS changes. The results showed that the GWS changes from mascon solutions (mascon-GWS) match best with in situ GWS changes, showing the highest correlation coefficient, lowest root mean square error (RMSE) values and nearest annual trend. Therefore, the Mascon-GWS changes are used for the spatial-temporal analysis of GWS changes. Based on which, the groundwater depletion rate of the Loess Plateau was -0.65 :-0.07 cm/year from 2005-2014, with a more severe consumption rate occurring in its eastern region, reaching about -1.5 cm/year, which is several times greater than those of the other regions. Furthermore, the precipitation and coal mining data were used for analyzing the causes of the groundwater depletion: the results showed that seasonal changes in groundwater storage are closely related to rainfall, but the groundwater consumption is mainly due to human activities; coal mining in particular plays a major role in the serious groundwater consumption in eastern region of the study area. Our results will help in groundwater resource management, ecological restoration, and policy planning for coal mining and economic development.},

Nevertheless, those intertidal platforms have undergone extensive losses due to human activities such as land reclamation. Identifying how tidal channel networks respond to land reclamation is critical to our prediction of the fate of residual tidal landforms. However, the morphological changes in the channel networks in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) impacted by severe reclamation remain unclear. Here, we analyzed the spatiotemporal dynamics of channel networks on two scales (the delta scale and the zone scale) under the double stress of land reclamation and natural pressure by comparing a comprehensive suite of morphological channel characteristics, including channel segment count, channel order, length, fractal dimension, drainage density and drainage efficiency. The results show that the interannual dynamics of tidal channel networks in the delta over the last three decades have experienced two periods: a favorable period during 1984-2000 and an adverse period during 2001-2018. The spatiotemporal patterns of channel networks varied with zones. land reclamation exerted a dominant influence on shifting the evolutionary trend of channel networks on both the delta scale and the zone scale when reclamation proportion exceeded a certain threshold. Sediment siltation could to a certain degree mitigate the impact of reclamation on tidal channel networks development. Our study highlighted the effect of reclamation on the geomorphological evolution of tidal channel networks and identified its impact threshold which could further be used to guide coastal zone restoration and management.

However, the blue and green evapotranspiration in irrigated fields and their contribution to blue and green water flows have not been identified in studies conducted on blue and green WRs. In addition, information on intra-annual variations in green water footprints (WFs) and water scarcities is limited. In particular, there is a lack of information on water consumption obtained from hydrological model-based blue and green water assessments at the basin scales. This study quantified, taking the Yellow River Basin (YRB) over 2010\textendash 2018 as the study case, the inter- and intra-annual variations in blue and green WRs, WFs and water scarcities at sub-basin levels. WRs and WFs were simulated using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model.

The blue and green WFs of the crops in the middle reach were significantly larger than those of the crops in the upper and lower reaches. There were visible spatial heterogeneities in water scarcities across the basin. Several areas in the middle reaches were subject to both blue and green water scarcities (at least modest level) for a minimum of three months a year.

Estimation of total basin discharge cannot only help us manage water resources well but also provide a better understanding about water resources variability and hydrologic cycle. In this study, the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) data combined with precipitation and evapotranspiration (ET) is used to present first estimate of total basin discharge (\textasciitilde 60.2 km3/year) based on water balance method over the entire Yarlung Tsangpo River basin during 2003\textendash 2014. The estimated basin discharge shows a good correlation with observed runoff (NSE = 0.70; NRMSE = 0.37; BIAS = -6.1\%). An artificial neural network (ANN) model is also proposed to build the relationship between terrestrial water storage anomalies (TWSAs) with the other hydrological data available (e.g., precipitation, temperature, ET, and soil moisture storage) during 2003\textendash 2010 and then applied to hindcasting TWSA before 2003 in order to generate a longer record of TWSA. The results show that ANN-generated TWSA using soil moisture storage and ET matches best with GRACE-derived TWSA during 2003\textendash 2010, showing a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.89 and a normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) of 0.40, which indicate that the ANN model is an effective way to generate TWSA beyond the GRACE data record. The comparison between total basin discharge using ANN-generated TWSA with the observed runoff data during 1998\textendash 2010 indicates a significant consistency with NSE = 0.66, NRMSE = 0.41, and BIAS = -4.9\%. Our findings illustrate that GRACE data and the ANN model can be jointly and effectively used to assess the total basin discharge in the large-scale basins with limited hydrological data.},

We examined sediment yield and its control variables in the plateau based on a multi-year dataset from 180 gauging stations in areas varying in size from 10(2) to 10(4) km(2). Various morphometric, hydrologic, climatic and land cover variables were estimated in order to understand and predict the variations in sediment yield. The results show a spatial pattern of sediment yield exhibiting an obvious zonal distribution and a coupling between precipitation and vegetation cover that fits the Langbein-Schumm law. A critical threshold of precipitation and vegetation cover was observed among the relationships of sediment yield and precipitation/vegetation cover. A multiple regression equation with three control variables, i.e. vegetation cover, percentage of cultivated loess and annual runoff, explains 65\% of the total variation in sediment yield. For the loess dominated basins, where the cultivated loess accounts for more than 60\% of the total area, annual runoff was the dominant variable, explaining 76\% of the observed variation in sediment yield. The established equation could be a valuable tool for predicting total sediment yield in the Loess Plateau. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

To determine the erosion and accretion pattern of the subaqueous YRD, bathometry data as well as the sediment discharge from the Lijin station over the period of 1976 to 2004 were analyzed. The erosion and accretion pattern of the subaqueous YRD was delineated by 1) the northern abandoned delta lobe, consisted of the heavily eroded Diaokou (DK) and Shenxiangou (SXG) lobes; 2) the active delta lobe, comprised of Qingshuigou (QSG) and Q8 lobes and featuring fast progradation; 3) the Laizhou Bay (LZB) with slight accumulation. Three stages were summarized based on the evolution of the northern abandoned delta lobe. During 1976-1980, the northern abandoned delta was severely eroded due to the cutoff of sediment supply. As the subaqueous slope became gentler during 1980-1996, the deeper part of the subaqueous delta turned into slight accretion state while the shallow part continued to be eroded. However, the erosion rate of the northern delta slowed down to a relatively balanced state during 1996-2004. Meanwhile, the development of the active delta lobe was a product of riverine sediment supply, channel geometry and estuarine hydrodynamics. Multi-depocenter was formed along the coastal area of the active subaqueous delta during 1976-1980, when multiple channels were active for sediment transportation. As the 01_manuscript river channel developed, the depocenter progradated eastward with an exceptional high accumulation rate during 1980-1985. The progradation direction turned southeastward with a lower accumulation rate during 1985-1996. Then, the depocenter shifted to the newly formed Q8 river mouth after a channel diversion in 1996, leaving the QSG river mouth in severe erosion. The channel diversion also caused erosion at the offshore area in LZB, where slight accumulation dominated before 1996. The erosion and accumulation pattern of the subaqueous YRD showed significant spatial and temporal variability during 1976-2004. A comprehensive understanding of their driven mechanisms would be critical for the prediction of the evolution of the YRD in the context of global change.},

The responses of regional geochemical characteristics to the relocation event, however, have not been well studied. In the present study, we performed detailed geochemical elemental analyses of a sediment core from the northern Yellow Sea and studied their geochemical responses to the 1855 AD relocation of the Yellow River estuary. The results show that TOC/TN, Co/Al2O3, Cr/Al2O3, Ni/Al2O3 and Se/Al2O3 ratios all decreased abruptly after 1855 AD, and similar decreases are observed in the sediments of the mud area southwest off the Cheju Island. These abrupt changes are very likely caused by the changes in source materials due to the relocation of the Yellow River estuary from the southern Yellow Sea to the Bohai Sea, which the corresponding decreasing trends caused by the changes in 01_manuscript source materials from those transported by the Liaohe River, the Haihe River and the Luanhe River to those by the Yellow River. Because the events have precise ages recorded in historical archives, these obvious changes in elemental geochemistry of sediments can be used to calibrate age models of related coastal sea sediments.},

The excessive water applied is also a cause of the dual problems of soil salinity and water logging in the upper YRB, which further negatively impacts crop yields. This study is aimed at modeling and analyzing the agro-ecohydrological processes and water use performance in large irrigation districts of the YRB. The Hetao Irrigation District (Hetao), a super-large irrigation district located in the upper YRB, was selected as a typical research area. A watershed hydrological model (SWAT-AG) with enhanced capacity for simulating regional agro-ecohydrological processes was adopted in this study. We simulated the agro-ecohydrological processes in Hetao and analyzed the regional characteristics of depth to groundwater table, soil moisture and salt content, evapotranspiration and crop yield. Water accounting was further carried out to interpret water cycle processes and evaluate water use performance in Hetao. Results indicated that Hetao was characterized by shallow depth to groundwater table, high soil moisture and high evapotranspiration. For farmland, there was a decreasing trend for both soil moisture and evapotranspiration from the upper to lower regions in Hetao, but this decreasing trend was not found for natural land. Further, results showed soil salt content has strong spatial variations with land use type, crops and shallow groundwater environments. Correspondingly, crop yields presented a decreasing trend from the upper to lower regions of Hetao, with large spatial variabilities closely related to the spatial distribution of soil water and salt conditions across Hetao. It was worth noting that the regional water use efficiency was relatively low in Hetao, especially with large proportions of non-beneficial water consumption to total water consumption. Overall, this study provided a thorough understanding of agro-ecohydrological processes and their regional characteristics, and the current situation of irrigation water use issues in the whole Hetao district, and further provided valuable insights in improving water use and management in large irrigation districts of the upper YRB.},

  abstract = {Located on the northeast edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China, the Yellow River source area (YRSA) is the river's major water source area and therefore it is called "water tower" of the Yellow River. However, the instrumental data are only 50-years, based on which the hydrological response at 100-1000 years cannot be understand properly. Although many results of streamflow reconstruction are published, the results of high resolution suspended sediment load (SSL) reconstruction have not been reported yet. Here we show that the Wanxiang Cave delta O-18 record (Zhang et al., 2008) can be used to reconstruct the SSL of the YRSA along with the mean annual streamflow, annual maximum discharge and precipitation. Based on the data of the overlapping period (1961-2001) after 5-year moving, calibration equations were established, using regression method. The R of annual stream flow, SSL, maximum discharge and precipitation with 5-year moving delta O-18 is - 0.768, - 0.763, - 0.692 and - 0.803, respectively, at p {$<$} 0.000001. After validation using Leave-One-Cross Validation method, we reconstructed the 1800-year variations in these variables. Based on statistical analysis, we proved the existence of the following cause-effect chain: the weakened (or strengthened) Asian Summer Monsoon recorded by cave delta O-18 -{$>$} increased (or decreased) water vapor to the YRSA -{$>$} increased (or decreased) precipitation -{$>$} increased (or decreased) streamflow -{$>$} increased (or decreased) SSL. These links provide the scientific basis for the paleo-hydrological reconstruction. Over the past 1800 years, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau's water tower effect on the Yellow River showed an overall decreasing trend, with the 5-year moving streamflow decreased at a rate of 4.81 million m(3)/year. Eight stages of alternative decrease and increase were identified, of which two long continuing decline stages are likely one of the factor that caused the collapse of the Tang and Ming dynasties. The uncertainties that should be considered to improve the model in the future are also discussed.},

The drainage area above Tangnaihai station is the source area of the Yellow River, which is located in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and yields 41.3 \% of the river's total natural runoff. Thus, it is known as the "water tower of the Yellow River." Based on climate and hydrometric data from 1956 to 2008, the purpose of this study is to deal with the influence of climate warming on the water cycle in this region and thereby to provide some knowledge for sustainable water resources management of the Yellow River. The statistical analysis shows basically no trend in annual precipitation, but a significant rising trend in air temperature. Hence, this area is ideal to study the response of the water cycle system to climate warming. We found non-linear variations in annual runoff (Q(w)) and the runoff-precipitation ratio (R-rp): they increased to a peak and then decreased. According to the response of R-rp to rising temperature, we established a three-stage descriptive model for the complex response of runoff generation to the rising air temperature. The mechanism of the complex response is explained based on the evidence of environmental changes previously reported in the study area, driven by rising temperatures.},

Here, we demonstrate that for millennia, human populations have resided in the same narrow part of the climatic envelope available on the globe, characterized by a major mode around {$\sim$}11 \textdegree C to 15 \textdegree C mean annual temperature (MAT). Supporting the fundamental nature of this temperature niche, current production of crops and livestock is largely limited to the same conditions, and the same optimum has been found for agricultural and nonagricultural economic output of countries through analyses of year-to-year variation. We show that in a business-as-usual climate change scenario, the geographical position of this temperature niche is projected to shift more over the coming 50 y than it has moved since 6000 BP. Populations will not simply track the shifting climate, as adaptation in situ may address some of the challenges, and many other factors affect decisions to migrate. Nevertheless, in the absence of migration, one third of the global population is projected to experience a MAT {$>$}29 \textdegree C currently found in only 0.8\% of the Earth's land surface, mostly concentrated in the Sahara. As the potentially most affected regions are among the poorest in the world, where adaptive capacity is low, enhancing human development in those areas should be a priority alongside climate mitigation.},

During the period studied, the Yellow River emptied into the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea, successively, and the deltas it created are known as the Abandoned and Modem Yellow River deltas. The growth of the Abandoned Yellow River delta can be divided into two stages. The first extended from AD 1194 to 157 8, during which the growth was rather slow. The second extended from AD 1579 to 1855, when the growth was greatly accelerated. The curve showing the temporal variation of the growth of the Modem Yellow River mouth can be fitted by three straight lines with different slopes. Accordingly, its growth from 1855 to present can be divided into three stages, and the inflection points associated with three straight lines may be regarded as threshold points, reflecting marked changes in the nature and extent of human activities. On this basis, a three-stage descriptive model has been proposed to describe the process of river mouth extension in response to changing human activities.},

It deals with characteristics of hyperconcentrated flows in the slope-channel systems in the gullied hilly areas on the Loess Plateau. The results show that the formation of hyperconcentrated flows is closely related to the vertical differentiation of landforms. Based on data from 21 rainfall events in the period 1963-1970, event-averaged suspended sediment concentration for hilltop, upper hillslope, lower hillslope and gully slope was calculated as 36 kg/m(3), 89 kg/m(3), 304 kg/m(3) and 505 kg/m(3), and the frequency of hyperconcentrated flows was 0.0, 0.17, 0.74 and 1.0, respectively. Thus, hyperconcentrated flows form on the lower part of hillslopes and on the gully slopes, and develope well in gully channels of various orders. There exists a sediment storing-releasing mechanism, resulting from different behaviours of sediment transport by non-hyperconcentrated and hyperconcentrated flows. When water flows are nonhyperconcentrated, the relatively coarse fractions of sediment from the slopes are deposited in the channel. When hyperconcentrated flows occur, the previously deposited coarse sediment may be eroded and released from the channel. A close relationship is found between rainstorms and the formation of hyperconcentrated flows, and some thresholds of rainfall and runoff for the occurrence of hyperconcentrated flows have been identified.},

  abstract = {According to the yearly maximum suspended sediment concentrations (SSC) in the Yellow River and its tributaries, the rivers are divided into three types of more than 300, 20-300, and less than 20 kg/m(3). The middle Yellow River basin is located in the transitional zone from subhumid to semiarid climates, and covered by a thick loess mantle. Neighboring on the desert areas to the northwest, the surface material of the Loess Plateau exhibits some marked areal differentiation in grain size and forms three zones covered by sandy loess, (typical) loess and clayey loess from northwest to southeast. Controlled by these physico-geographical conditions, the grain size of river-transported sediment shows some particular characteristics; at small water discharge or SSC, the grain size of suspended sediment abruptly decreases to a minimum with increasing water discharge or SSC. At water discharge of more than ca. 40 m(3)/s or at SSC of more than ca. 40 kg/m(3), the grain size increases with water discharge or SSC. During the low-stage season, the relatively clear baseflow may scour the coarse bed materials, so the suspended sediment is relatively coarse. In the rainy season, rainstorm runoff washes out fine loess materials to the river, making suspended sediment fine. During relatively strong rainstorms, there often occur hyperconcentrated flows at SSC of more than 300 kg/m(3). The relatively coarse grains could then remain suspended in the mixture of water and fine suspended sediment. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Through analysis of the relationship between the mean annual number of sandstorms and the mean annual precipitation, an original sandstorm zone and a secondary high-frequency zone of sandstorms have been defined. The latter is mainly formed as a result of human activities, such as vegetation destruction and waste-land cultivation, and not because of climatic change. The secondary sandstorm zone is located 350-500 km away from the original sandstorm zone, reflecting the fact that the sandstorm zone in the Loess Plateau area has shifted 350-500 km to the southeast, in response to human impact. Some abrupt change has been found in the area where the mean annual precipitation is 270 mm, where the original sandstorm zone ends and a secondary zone of high-frequency sandstorms begins. This transition area can be regarded as an abnormally unstable area.

  abstract = {The Yellow River basin, an important agricultural and industrial region and the "Cradle of Chinese Civilization," is facing serious water shortage. The particular climatological and hydrologic conditions together with the disproportional development of economics are currently making sustainable water supply a rather complex and difficult task. Even so, the population still continues to increase, which poses considerable pressure on the already overburdened water resources in the study area. Traditional supply-oriented water resources management has proven to be insufficient to efficiently integrate the socio-economic development, environmental ecosystem, and limited renewable water resources. The Yellow River should be envisioned from broader perspectives, not only to recognize the symbolic dimension of the water resources management from a source of public goods or commodity water but also to regard the river basin as an ecosystem worthy of preservation and protection for future generations. An overview on the availability and demand aspects of the water resources in the Yellow River basin is presented, and the present and future situations of the water shortage are evaluated. In addition, perspectives on a new demand-oriented water resources management plan, in an effort to shift water resources management towards sustainability in the Yellow River basin, are proposed.},

  abstract = {In the past 50 years, influenced by global climate change, the East Asian summer monsoon intensity (SMI) changed significantly, leading to a response by the water cycle of the Yellow River basin. The variation in SMI has three stages: ( 1) 1951-1963, SMI increased; ( 2) 1963-1965, SMI declined sharply, a feature that may be regarded as an abrupt change; and ( 3) 1965-2000, SMI remained at low levels and showed a tendency to decline slowly. The decreased SMI led to a reduction in water vapour transfer from the ocean to the Yellow River basin, and thus precipitation decreased and the natural river runoff of the Yellow River also decreased. Due to the increase in population and therefore in irrigated land area, the ratio of net water diversion to natural river runoff increased continuously. Comparison of the ratio of net water diversion to natural river runoff before and after the abrupt change in SMI indicates some discontinuity in the response of the man-induced lateral branch of the water cycle to the abrupt change in SMI. The frequently occurring flow desiccation in the lower Yellow River can be regarded as a response of the water cycle system to the decreasing summer monsoon intensity and increasing population. When the ratio of net water diversion exceeded the ratio of natural runoff of the low-flow season to the annual total natural runoff, flow desiccation in the lower Yellow River would occur. When the ratio of net water diversion is 0.3 larger than the ratio of the natural runoff of the low-flow season to the annual total natural runoff, an abrupt increase in the number of flow desiccation events is likely to occur.},

  abstract = {In the past 50 years, influenced by global climate change, the Eastern Asian summer monsoon intensity (SMI) changed significantly, and that has led to some response in the water cycle system of the Yellow River basin and in the land accretion process of the delta. The variation in annual precipitation is synchronic with that in SMI. From 1950 to 1970, annual air temperature showed a slight decrease with large fluctuations. Since 1970, a significant increasing trend can be seen. Climate change may result in a change in sediment flux into the sea, and therefore in a change in the rate of land accretion of delta (R-1a). The annual R-1a and sediment flux into the sea showed an increasing trend from 1952 to 1964, but a decreasing trend after 1964, which is similar to that in the SMI. Human activity such as soil conservation measures and water division also has some effect on land accretion of the delta. A multiple regression analysis indicates that the R-a1 decreased with decrease in summer monsoon index (SMI), increase in annual temperature (T), the increase in the area of water and soil conservation measures (A(tfg)) and an increase in water diversion (Q(w,div)). The contribution of the variations in the variables to the variation in R-1a was estimated as 34.94\%, 3.80\%, 53.82\% and 7.44\%, respectively. The contribution of the two climate factors totals 38.7\%, indicating that the influence of global climate change on the variation in land accretion of Yellow River delta is significant.

Two kinds of downscaling techniques (delta and statistical methods) were used to generate future possible local meteorological variables including temperature and precipitation in the study area. The downscaled data was then used as input to the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model to simulate the corresponding future streamflow regime in the headwater catchment of the Yellow River basin. Three benchmark periods simulated were 2010-2039 (2020s), 2040-2069 (2050s) and 2070-2099 (2080s). Although four GCMs and two downscaling techniques do not provide identical results, the time series generated by four GCMs and both downscaling methods indicate a significant increasing trend in both maximum and minimum temperature values, and a slight increasing trend in precipitation. The hydrological impact analysis made with the downscaled temperature and precipitation time series as input to the SWAT model suggested an overall decreasing trend in mean annual streamflow in the headwater catchment of the Yellow River basin in three benchmark periods in the future. The scenario analysis made in this study raised questions over the availability of future water resources in the Yellow River basin, which will increase the shortage of water resources at both middle and downstream of the Yellow River basin, where the demand for water resources from industrial, agricultural and domestic sectors will continue to increase in the future.

In the present study, the above capability-load relation is quantified using Lane's relation, gamma QJ-Q(s)D(50), wherein Q is water discharge, J is channel slope, Q(s) is sediment transport rate, D-50 is median size of bed material, and gamma is the specific weight of water. On this basis, we have established scour-fill thresholds for the lower Yellow River based on data from 141 flood events. The results show that the Q(s)D(50)-gamma QJ relation may well distinguish between the scour and fill flood events. The following equation has been established: SDRFE = 0.00099(gamma QJ)(0.90()Q(s)D(50))(-0.60), wherein SDRFE is channel sediment delivery ratio. From the equation, the scour-fill threshold is established as: Q(s)D(50) = 0.00001 (gamma QJ)(1.5). Starting from this formula, four possible options are proposed for sediment management of the lower Yellow River. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Controlled by continental monsoon climate, runoff of the Yellow River shows large temporal variability. How runoff responds to the changing summer monsoon intensity is important both in theory and in water resources management. The earliest hydrological observations on the Yellow River started in 1919, and thus, runoff data are available only for the past 90 years. Using data of the summer monsoon intensity (SMI), the temporal variation of SMI since 1873 and the resultant variation in runoff are dealt with for the drainage area between Hekouzhen and Longmen, Yellow River basin. At the 128-year scale, the variation of SMI can be generalized as a trend of decreasing first, then increasing and then decreasing again. At the time scale of 50 years for which concurrent data are available, the temporal variations in both SMI and precipitation show some decreasing trend. At the time scale of 80 years for which concurrent data were available, the temporal variations in SMI and natural runoff also show a decreasing trend. For 5-year moving averages of these variables, the synchronous trend of variation is more obvious. This fact indicates that the variation in SMI results in the variations in precipitation and runoff in the study area. Based on data of SMI and natural runoff for the period from 1920 to 2000, a regression equation between the 5-year moving averages of SMI (SMI5m) and natural runoff (Q (wn,5m)) was established, which shows that 72\% of the variation in Q (wn,5m) can be explained by the variation in SMI5m. Using this regression equation, Q (wn,5m) for the period from 1873 to 1919 was reconstructed. At the 128-year scale, the natural runoff from the study area shows a trend of decreasing first, then increasing and then decreasing again, in response to the similar variation in the summer monsoon intensity.},

Satellite-derived vegetation greenness and in situ measured hydrometeorological datasets were used. Average annual reference evapotranspiration (ET0) showed significant decreasing trend (p {$<$} 0.05) by 0.32 mm year(-1) over the past 55 years. Results obtained from recovered stationary series and sensitivity analyses showed that reduction of wind speed was the major driving force for decreasing trends in annual and seasonal ET0. Water budget-derived actual evapotranspiration (ETa) increased dramatically during the study period, whereas potential evapotranspiration (ETp) calculated from Penman equation and pan evaporation (ETpan) decreased significantly, suggesting the existence of evaporation paradox over the UYRB. ETa and ETp or ETpan exhibited complementary behavior, while the complementary relationship was asymmetric. During the period 1982-2014, vegetation greening occurred in most areas (65.6\%) of the UYRB and was mediated by elevation. Interestingly, non-uniform climate warming imposed opposite impacts on vegetation growth, namely inter-annual and seasonal NDVI was stimulated by daytime temperature but suppressed by nighttime temperature. Furthermore, the positive impacts imposed by daytime temperature on NDVI was much larger in spring than in autumn and summer. Large-scale coherent vegetation greening would be the primary factor affecting inter-annual ETa in comparison with climate factors. These results help in deep understanding the hydrological response to climate change in cold mountain regions.},

Results of the simulation of the groundwater dynamics of the study area show that water-saving practices referring to canal lining and upgrading hydraulic structures applied in 60\% of the area, and upgraded farm irrigation technology in 50\% of the area may consist of a reasonable solution. Their implementation would lead to reduce groundwater evaporation by 43~mm and the total diversions from the Yellow River by 208 mm, i.e. about 20\% of present volumes diverted. Most of routines and strategies for model construction may also be used for other regions, especially for irrigation districts in the upper Yellow River basin.},

The temporal-spatial distribution, anomaly distribution and sub-regional temporal variations of the terrestrial surface dry and wet conditions were analyzed as well. The results showed a decreasing trend in the annual average surface humidity from the southeast to the northwest in the research area. Over the period of 1961-2008, an aridification tendency appeared sharply in the central interior region of the Loess Plateau, and less sharply in the middle part of the region. The border region showed the weakest tendency of aridification. It is clear that aridification diffused in all directions from the interior region. The spatial anomaly distribution of the terrestrial surface dry and wet conditions on the Loess Plateau can be divided into three key areas: the southern, western and eastern regions. The terrestrial annual humidity index displayed a significantly descending trend and showed remarkable abrupt changes from wet to dry in the years 1967,1977 and 1979. In the above mentioned three key areas for dry and wet conditions, the terrestrial annual humidity index exhibited a fluctuation period of 3-4 years, while in the southern region, a fluctuation period of 7-8 years existed at the same time.},

  abstract = {Semi-arid areas of northern China are under increasing pressures from anthropogenic activities and climate change. Although wetland areas in these drylands have experienced dramatic, unidirectional shifts in their ecological status in recent centuries, fundamental driving forces are poorly quantified. Here, we examine changes in sedimentary proxies (diatoms, spectrally-inferred chlorophyll-a, stable isotopes) preserved in a radiometrically-dated core from Tianchi Lake, an alpine lake within the margin of the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM) limit in China's southwestern Loess Plateau. Our algal trends were compared with regional instrumental records, changes in EASM intensity, and with previously published paleolimnological data from this same lake to determine the principal drivers of regional ecological changes. We found no clear evidence that geochemical and biological proxies were strongly affected by deforestation and other human activities. Major environmental changes during the past similar to 200 years were found to be predominantly driven by climatic fluctuations, extreme precipitation events, and changes in EASM intensity. Prior to similar to 1965 CE, diatom assemblages indicate an oligotrophic, clear water state. Shifts in dominance between benthic Staurosirella pinnata and planktonic Lindavia comensis were likely controlled by ice-cover dynamics. Between similar to 1965 and 1980 CE an abrupt shift to a turbid water state during a period of extreme precipitation events was caused by excessive nutrient-laden soil erosion in the already susceptible deforested catchment. This turbid period was evidenced by a rapid increase to dominance of Achnanthidium minutissimum, a sharp decline in oligotrophic Lindavia comensis, increased primary production, and peaks in sediment grain size and SiO2 content. Post- similar to 1980 CE, we provide evidence that a shift towards planktonic diatom dominance can best be explained by changes in climate and EASM intensity, despite substantial nitrogen deposition in the region during the past few decades. Specifically, a drier and warmer climate together with weakened EASM wind strength resulted in decreased erosion and a return to a clear water state, coupled with enhanced thermal stability. Collectively, these observations expand our understanding of how changes in climate, extreme precipitation events, and fluctuations in EASM intensity influence semi-arid alpine lakes in northern China, as well as climate's leading role in driving ecological change over the past two centuries, despite the intensification of human disturbances during recent decades.},

  abstract = {Agriculture in the semiarid region is undergoing radical changes driven by global warming and increasing incidences of extreme weather events. Predicting and evaluating the responses of crop yield and water use patterns of rainfed cropping systems according to future temperature and precipitation changes could provide important information regarding adoption of climate-smart farming systems that could offer great resilience and sustainability. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential changes in agronomic productivity, hydrological balance and economic profitability of cropping systems with perennial legumes and rotation on the Loess Plateau of China affected by different future temperature and precipitation scenarios using APSIM-based modeling. Five different cropping systems were investigated: (i) continuous maize (Zea mays) (M), (ii) continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) (W), (iii) continuous lucerne (Medicago sativa) (L), (iv) maize-wheat-soybean (Gyleine max) rotation (MWS) and (v) lucerne (4-yr)-winter wheat (2-yr) rotation (LW) in Xifeng, Gansu, China. Five series of temperature and precipitation changes scenarios (no changes in atmospheric CO2 concentrations were considered) based on RCPs (representative concentration pathways) were integrated into scenario simulations, including the baseline scenario (1980-2010), mid-century scenarios of RCP4.5 (M45) and RCP8.5 (M85), and end-century scenarios of RCP4.5 (E45) and RCP8.5 (E85). The results showed that, compared with baseline simulations, mean maize yield under RCPs decreased by 6.7 0 /0-37.7 \%, and the mean wheat yield decreased by 1.7 \%-23.6 \%. Lucerne yield consistently increased by 7.2 \%-12.3 \% under M45 and E45. Although different cropping systems affected the yield to a certain extent, only the difference between the wheat yields of W and MWS was significant (P {$<$} 0.05). On a cropping system level of every 6-yr (totally five phases for a scenario of 30-yr), the temperature and precipitation changes did not significantly affect plant transpiration (T-c) per phase. For all systems except L [which received its highest soil evaporation (E-s) per phase in baseline], the greatest E-s per phase was found in the E85. L tended to provide greater T-c per phase and evapotranspiration (ET) per phase (ranging from 1219 to 1332 mm and 2910-3034 mm, respectively), followed by LW. L and MWS presented the highest and lowest E-s per phase (1636-1724 and 1592-1677 mm), respectively. The gross profit (GP per 6-yr phase) and water productivity (WP per 6-yr phase) of L were the greatest among all cropping systems (11.5-13.7 thousand US\$ ha(-1) per phase and 3.72-4.41 US\$ ha(-1) mm(-1) per phase, respectively), followed by LW and MWS. For M, W and MWS, the GP per phase and the WP per phase were predicted to be greater under the baseline than under any of the RCPs, whereas M45 and E45 scenarios improved the GP per phase and WP per phase of L and LW compared with those of the baseline. In general, we advocate that LW-based systems have the greatest potential for producing acceptable yield and economic profit under future temperature and precipitation scenarios for this local environment.},

  abstract = {A watershed can be simulated as a multiagent system (MAS) composed of spatially distributed land and water users (agents) within a common defined environment. The watershed system is characterized by distributed decision processes at the agent level with a coordination mechanism organizing the interactions among individual decision processes at the system level. This paper presents a decentralized (distributed) optimization method known as constraint-based reasoning, which allows individual agents in an MAS to optimize their behaviors over various alternatives. The method incorporates the optimization of all agents' objectives through an interaction scheme, in which the ith agent optimizes its objective with a selected priority for collaboration and forwards the solution and consequences to all agents that interact with it. Agents are allowed to determine how important their own objectives are in comparison with the constraints, using a local interest factor ({$\beta$}i). A large {$\beta$}i value indicates a selfish agent who puts high priority on its own benefit and ignores collaboration requirements. This bottom-up problem-solving approach mimics real-world watershed management problems better than conventional ``top-down'' optimization methods in which it is assumed that individual agents will completely comply with any recommendations that the coordinator makes. The method is applied to a steady state hypothetical watershed with three off-stream human agents, one in-stream human agent (reservoir), and two ecological agents.},

  abstract = {Global water interdependencies are likely to increase with growing virtual water trade. To address the issues of the indirect effects of water trade through the global economic circulation, we use ecological network analysis (ENA) to shed insight into the complicated system interactions. A global model of virtual water flow among agriculture and livestock production trade in 1995\textendash 1999 is also built as the basis for network analysis. Control analysis is used to identify the quantitative control or dependency relations. The utility analysis provides more indicators for describing the mutual relationship between two regions/countries by imitating the interactions in the ecosystem and distinguishes the beneficiary and the contributor of virtual water trade system. Results show control and utility relations can well depict the mutual relation in trade system, and direct observable relations differ from integral ones with indirect interactions considered. This paper offers a new way to depict the interrelations between trade components and can serve as a meaningful start as we continue to use ENA in providing more valuable implications for freshwater study on a global scale.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion on disturbed soil accumulations severely threatens the ecological stability of construction sites and their surrounding areas. This study aims to quantify the effects of hedgerows on the hydraulic characteristics of runoff and understand the mechanism of runoff and sediment reduction of hedgerow slopes. A field scouring-erosion experiment was conducted on a typical spoiled ground in "Changwu Agricultural Ecological Experimental Station" of the Loess Plateau in China to explore the effects of hedgerows on erosion control in slopes of disturbed soil accumulation. In experiments, 6 plots, which consisted of three hedgerow plots (H) and three control plots of bare slope (C), with a uniform size of 20 m, 5 in width, and 0.5 m height were constructed with excavated soil. By using three different flow discharges (35, 45, and 55 L/min) on the slope with three different gradients (24 degrees, 28 degrees and 32 degrees), some essential parameters, rate of sediment yield, sediment concentration of runoff, sediment reduction, shear stress, denudation rate, and runoff power, were measured for mechanism analysis. The hedgerows could delay runoff, which meant the initial runoff time of hedgerows obviously lagged behind the control plot about 1-8 min. The capability of runoff generating control by the hedgerows depended on the duration of discharge, which grew first and reduced later. At the later stage, the sediment concentration in the runoff of the hedgerow plots exceeded the control plots, which could be related to transformation of hedgerows between source and sink. The accumulated sediment yields of the hedgerow plots were reduced by 10-45\% compared to the control plots. The relationship of the reduction of accumulated sediment yield and duration of discharge could be stated with quadratic function (P {$<$} 0.01), which indicated critical runoff time was advanced with increase of slope and flow discharge. Based on the runoff power, the soil erodibility parameter of the hedgerow slopes (3.58 g.N-1.m(-1)) was larger than that of the control slopes (2.83 g.N-1.m(-1)). Hedgerows could hinder soil transport, which not only reduced soil peeling, increased critical shear stress, and critical runoff power but also curbed rill evolution in the lower slope erosion process. The important parameters from this study would be helpful for optimal allocation of hedgerow measures, erosion control and erosion prediction model establishment on disturbed soil accumulation.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, both observation and simulation data have demonstrated an obvious decrease in runoff and soil moisture, with increasing evapotranspiration, over the Loess Plateau. In this study, we employed a Variable Infiltration Capacity model coupled with scenario simulation to explore the impact of change in climate and land cover on four hydrological variables (HVs) over the Loess Plateau, i.e., evapotranspiration (ET), runoff (Runoff), shallow soil moisture (SM1), and deep soil moisture (SM2). Results showed precipitation, rather than temperature, had the closest relationship with the four HVs, with r ranging from 0.76 to 0.97 (p {$<$} 0.01), and this was therefore presumed to be the dominant climate-based driving factor in the variation of hydrological regimes. Vegetation conversion, from cropland and grassland to woodland, significantly reduced runoff and increased soil moisture consumption, to sustain an increased ET, and, assuming that the reduction of SM2 is entirely evaporated, we can attribute 71.28\% +/- 18.64\%, 65.89\% +/- 24.14\% of the ET increase to the water loss of SM2 in the two conversion modes, respectively. The variation in HVs, induced by land cover change, were higher than the expected climate change with respect to SM1, while different factors were selected to determine HVs variation in six catchments, due to differences in the mode and intensity of vegetation conversion, and the degree of climate change. Our findings are critical for understanding and quantifying the impact of climate change and vegetation conversions, and provide a further basis for the design of water resources and land-use management strategies with respect to climate change, especially in the water-limited Loess Plateau.},

  abstract = {Tidal barriers isolate intertidal areas from tides, creating distinct conditions on either side of the barrier, and freshwater releases change the receiving area's hydrology and salinity. However, the combined effect of these human actions is unknown. Using the macrobenthos community as a bioindicator, we sampled part of the northern Yellow River Delta that has been managed using tidal barriers and freshwater releases, in the spring and autumn of 2014, before and after the summer freshwater release. The macrobenthos communities differed greatly on opposite sides of the barrier. During the spring, 7 to 8 species were found inside the barrier (mainly Insecta and Crustacea), versus 22 in the intertidal area (mainly Polychaetes, Mollusca, Crustacea, and Insecta). During the autumn, 10 to 13 species were found inside the barrier and 16 in the intertidal area. Non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering divided the macrobenthos communities into groups that mostly agreed with the spatial distribution of the investigated areas. The characteristics of the modified ecosystems determined the similarity of the macrobenthos communities. The effects of the tidal barriers and the freshwater releases interacted: the barriers decreased sediment salinity compared with that in the intertidal area, and freshwater releases increased this differentiation. To restore the delta's original freshwater ecosystems, the tidal barriers are required to contain the freshwater releases. In addition, the effects of the freshwater releases were generally positive. Therefore, it is reasonable to retain the barriers and to continue or increase these releases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {In this study, a MCMC-based maximum entropy copula (abbreviated as MCMC-MEC) method is developed for assessing drought risk under uncertainty. MCMC-MEC has advantages in analyzing the bivariate drought risk (i.e. duration and severity) through runs-theory, improving the fitting processes of drought variables based on maximum entropy, and reflecting the uncertainties in bivariate drought risk assessment through MCMC. Then, MCMC-MEC is applied to the Amu Darya River Basin, a typical arid and semi-arid basin in Central Asia. Results disclose that, during 1935\textendash 2015, the study basin experienced about 42 drought events, average duration of each drought was 5~months (severity 4.38), and the most severe drought event lasted for 25.3~months (severity 27.9). Results also reveal that uncertainty in parameter of copula has effects on drought risk, and duration and severity would increase with confidence level of univariate drought probability. At confidence level of 0.9, the bivariate drought risk would be 4\%-6\% (duration~{$\geq~$}7.0~months and severity~{$\geq~$}5.8); at confidence level of 0.95, the drought risk would be 1\%-2\% (duration~{$\geq~$}10.0~months and severity~{$\geq~$}10.6). During 2005\textendash 2015, drought risk for the study basin was increased due to the decreasing precipitation and runoff, and their contribution rates to the drought risk were 55.8\% and 44.2\%, respectively. The findings are helpful for providing decision support of drought management and disaster prevention.},

However, previous studies mostly focused on crop water productivity from a single physical perspective. Little attention is paid to synergies and trade-offs between water consumption and economic value creation of crop production. Distinguishing between blue and green water composition, grain and cash crops, and irrigation and rainfed production modes in China, this study calculates the production-based WF (PWF) and derives the economic value-based WF (EWF) of 14 major crops in 31 provinces for each year over 2001\textendash 2016. The synergy evaluation index (SI) of PWF and EWF is proposed to reveal the synergies and trade-offs of crop water productivity and its economic value from the WF perspective. Results show that both the PWF and EWF of most considered crops in China decreased with the increase in crop yield and prices. The high (low) values of both the PWF and EWF of grain crops tended to cluster obviously in space and there existed a huge difference between blue and green water in economic value creation. Moreover, the SI revealed a serious incongruity between PWFs and EWFs both in grain and cash crops. Negative SI values occurred mostly in north-west China for grain crops, and overall more often and with lower values for cash crops. Unreasonable regional planting structure and crop prices resulted in this incongruity, suggesting the need to promote regional coordinated development to adjust the planting structure according to local conditions and to regulate crop prices rationally.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, the contribution of terrace construction and vegetation restoration projects to sediment discharge reduction remains uncertain. In this paper, eight catchments located in the Loess Plateau were chosen to explore the effects of different driving factors on sediment discharge changes during the period from the 1960s to 2012. Attribution approaches were applied to evaluate the effects of climate, terrace, and vegetation coverage changes on sediment discharge. The results showed that the annual sediment discharge decreased significantly in all catchments ranging from -0.007 to -0.039 Gt.yr(-1). Sediment discharge in most tributaries has shown abrupt changes since 1996, and the total sediment discharge was reduced by 60.1\% during 1997-2012. We determined that increasing vegetation coverage was the primary factor driving the reductions in sediment loads since 1996 and accounted for 47.7\% of the total reduction. Climate variability and terrace construction accounted for 9.1\% and 18.6\% of sediment discharge reductions, respectively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Furthermore, the contribution of climate changes to streamflow was revealed by Budyko's method and a simple water balance model. The following results were obtained: (i) decreasing abruptness in streamflow occurred in 1990, and this date was used to divide the streamflow into two periods (baseline period and period of change); (ii) 67 of 80 stations showed decreasing trends with an average reduction of 10.37\% of annual precipitation changes, while most of the stations displayed increasing trends with a 3.71\% increase in annual ETp; (iii) the precipitation and ETp elasticity of streamflow, as expected, revealed that streamflow increases with increasing precipitation, whereas it decreases with increasing ETp; and (iv) the changes of precipitation and ETp reflected complementary effects on the reduction of streamflow from the baseline period to the period of change, the decreasing trend in precipitation being the 01_manuscript cause for the reduction of streamflow, but the declining rates of ETp causing a slight increase in streamflow.},

  abstract = {Information for the interspecific variation in plant stemflow production may provide important implications for their survival in drought conditions. Our objectives were to determine if stemflow generation varied with plant species and to ascertain their possible responses to rainfall characteristics and plant morphology. Stemflow volume (SFv), stemflow depth (SFD), stemflow percentages of gross rainfall (SFD/GR), and funnelling ratio (FR, a quantitative index to evaluate water enrichment by stemflow) were quantified in 2014 and 2015 for coexisting two tree species (Pines tabulifomis and Armeniaca vulgaris) and two shrub species (Salix psammophila and Caragana korshinskii) on the Loess Plateau of China. The results indicated that the generation of stemflow varied significantly among the studied four species. The shrub species had larger values of SFv, SFD , and SFD/GR than tree species. FR values revealed that the soil at the plant bases for P. tabuliformis, A. vulgaris, S. psarrunophila, and C. korshinskii, could receive averages of 13.1-, 23.9-, 78.2-, and 124.9-fold more rainwater, respectively, than an equivalent open area. Characteristics of rainfall had a notable influence on stemflow production. Specifically, SFN, and SFD were all positively and linearly correlated with rainfall in 2014 and 2015. SFD/GR and FR increased linearly with rainfall in 2014, whereas increased exponentially or even decreased after reaching a rainfall threshold in 2015. Significant influence of plant morphology on stemflow production was only observed for P. tabuliformis but not for the other species. In conclusion, the studied two shrub species (S. psammophila and C. korshinskii) were morphologically more effective than the tree species (P. tabuliformis and A. vulgaris) in funnelling rainwater to the soil of the basal area. This could be eco-hydrologically significant for their survival in drought environments.},

  abstract = {On the basis of the bathymetric records of 371 survey sections in the present Huanghe mouth area from 1996 to 2001, the temporal and spatial variations of the Huanghe mouth bars were studied by using GIS technology. The variation of the mouth bars is closely related to the water and sediment discharges from the Huanghe River to the sea that has been decreasing drastically in recent years, and to coastal hydrodynamic regimes. The characteristics of the mouth bars are unique in contrast with those of other estuaries in the world. (1) The mouth bars of the Huanghe River consist of many small sandbars. Usually the sandbars are of ellipse-shape with the long axis of about 1 similar to 6 km, and short axis of about 1 similar to 4 km. The long axis is parallel to the principal direction of tidal current, and the short axis is variable, depending on the local dynamics. The crest of the sandbars is only about 0.4 m below the water surface at low tide. They are distributed within an area of 20 km(2), not far from the river mouth area. The present mouth bars are in small-medium size, quite different from the large one formed during the 1970s and 1980s, when the river sediment discharge was several times larger than that after 1996. (2) The scale of a river mouth bar is related to the river discharge of that year. In 1997 sediment discharge from the Huanghe River was 42 Mt, and the mouth bar consisted of several small scattered sandbars. In 1998 the size of mouth bars was much larger than that in 1997, as the sediment discharge from the Huanghe River increased to 363 Mt. Variation of the mouth bars largely depends on the sediment discharge with a correlation coefficient of 0.78. The calculation of the volume of the mouth bar area shows that about 30\%similar to 40\% of the river's into-sea sediment is deposited in the mouth bar area. (3) Compared with other large estuaries in the world, the Huanghe mouth bars have three unique features in responding to its high sediment concentration: small size, steep slope gradient and shallow crest depth.},

After reviewing the social-ecological effects of 23 ecosystem restoration programs in Asia's drylands, we find that these programmes mainly contribute to sustainable development goals (SDGs) synergistically, but the trade-offs between social-ecological effects still exist. Among the five goals of SDG15 (Life on Land), SDG13 (Climate Action), SDG6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), SDG1 (No poverty), and SDG2 (Zero Hunger), 11 programs can synergistically achieve no less than three goals, especially grassland restoration and water diversion in China, as well as water management programmes in Israel. However, the contribution of ecosystem restoration programs to SDG15 easily weakens SDG6, SDG1, and SDG2, indicating the competition of land and water between ecosystem restoration and agriculture. To reduce the trade-offs among SGDs caused by ecosystem restoration, we propose the social-ecological system research framework of 'Dryland Boundary \textendash{} Water, Food, Energy and Ecosystem Nexus \textendash{} Meta-coupling \textendash{} Nature-based Solutions' to guide the implementation of ecosystem restoration programmes from four aspects: supply\textendash demand matching, element matching, regional matching, and local adaptation.},

Results show that the runoff and sediment load of the stream declined gradually in 1960-2012. According to the abrupt change point detected, the runoff and sediment series were divided into two periods: 1960-1998 and 1999-2012. The reductions of runoff and sediment load in 1999-2012 were found to be related to climate change and human activities, and the latter played a dominant role with a contribution of about 68\% and 75\%, respectively. The effects of rainfall intensity should be considered to avoid overestimating or underestimating the contributions of rainfall changes to the variations of runoff and sediment load in the semiarid region. An inspection of changes in water discharge and sediment regime indicated that the frequency of discharge between 0 and 5 m(3)/s increased while that between 5 and 1000 m(3)/s decreased in 2006-2012. This phenomenon can be attributed principally to the soil and water conservation practices.},

In the context of climate change, few studies have investigated resilience of social ecological system (SER) from the perspective of permafrost that restricts the hydrothermal condition of alpine grassland ecosystem. In this paper, based on the structural dynamics, we developed the numerical model for the SER in the permafrost regions of the source of Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics and sensitivity of the SER, and estimated the effect of permafrost change on the SER. The results indicate that: 1) the SER has an increasing trend, especially after 1997, which is the joint effect of precipitation, temperature, NPP and ecological conservation projects; 2) the SER shows the spatial feature of high in southeast and low in northwest, which is consistent with the variation trends of high southeast and low northwest for the precipitation, temperature and NPP, and low southeast and high northwest for the altitude; 3) the high sensitive regions of SER to the permafrost change have gradually transited from the island distribution to zonal and planar distribution since 1980, moreover, the sensitive degree has gradually reduced; relatively, the sensitivity has high value in the north and south, and low value in the south and east; 4) the thickness of permafrost active layer shows a highly negative correlation with the SER. The contribution rate of permafrost change to the SER is -4.3\%, that is, once the thickness of permafrost active layer increases 1 unit, the SER would decrease 0.04 units.},

We here present an indirect method using in situ Rn-222 measurements to estimate groundwater discharge into rivers and lakes in the SAYR. Rn-222 was measured in rivers, lakes, groundwater and springs during three sampling periods (2014-2016), and the results indicate large variability in the concentration of the isotope. The data also indicate decreasing Rn-222 trends in groundwater in the cold season (the Feb-2015 sampling period) which may be linked to frequency of capturing Rn-222 in the frozen ground caused by geocryogenic processes. In addition, permafrost spatial extent and freeze-thaw processes have strongly affected the hydrological conditions in the region.},

  abstract = {Abstract. The streamflow of the Yellow River (YR) is strongly affected by human activities like irrigation and dam operation. Many attribution studies have focused on the long-term trends of streamflows, yet the contributions of these anthropogenic factors to streamflow fluctuations have not been well quantified with fully mechanistic models. This study aims to (1)~demonstrate whether the mechanistic global land surface model ORCHIDEE (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms) is able to simulate the streamflows of this complex rivers with human activities using a generic parameterization for human activities and (2)~preliminarily quantify the roles of irrigation and dam operation in monthly streamflow fluctuations of the YR from 1982 to 2014 with a newly developed irrigation module and an offline dam operation model. Validations with observed streamflows near the outlet of the YR demonstrated that model performances improved notably with incrementally considering irrigation (mean square error (MSE) decreased by 56.9\,\%) and dam operation (MSE decreased by another 30.5\,\%). Irrigation withdrawals were found to substantially reduce the river streamflows by approximately 242.8{$\pm$}27.8\texttimes 108\,m3\,yr-1 in line with independent census data (231.4{$\pm$}31.6\texttimes 108\,m3\,yr-1). Dam operation does not change the mean streamflows in our model, but it impacts streamflow seasonality, more than the seasonal change of precipitation. By only considering generic operation schemes, our dam model is able to reproduce the water storage changes of the two large reservoirs, LongYangXia and LiuJiaXia (correlation coefficient of {$\sim$}\,0.9). Moreover, other commonly neglected factors, such as the large operation contribution from multiple medium/small reservoirs, the dominance of large irrigation districts for streamflows (e.g., the Hetao Plateau), and special management policies during extreme years, are highlighted in this study. Related processes should be integrated into models to better project future YR water resources under climate change and optimize adaption strategies.},

The result indicates that change of temperature in the region has an obvious corresponding relationship with global warming and the changes of annual average temperature in each subregion in the region have been presenting a fluctuant and rising state in the past 50 years. However the change of precipitation is more intricate than the change of temperature in the region because of the influences of the different geographical positions and environments in various areas, and the change of annual precipitation in the 01_manuscript runoff-producing area has been presenting a fluctuant and decreasing state in the past 50 years. And there is a remarkable nonlinear correlativity between runoff and precipitation and temperature in the region. The runoff in the region has been decreasing continuously since 1990 because the precipitation in the 01_manuscript runoff-producing area obviously decreases and the annual average temperature continuously rises. As a whole, the runoff in each subregion of the headwater region of the Yellow River is quite sensitive to precipitation change, while the runoff in the subregion above Jimai is more sensitive to temperature change than that in the others in the region, correspondingly.},

This paper, taking the Yangou Basin as a case study and using day-by-day meteorological data of Yan'an station in 2005, simulated and analyzed the quantitative relation between crop yield, soil and water loss and topographic condition with the aid of WIN-YIELD software. Results show that: 1) topographic gradient has important influence on crop yield. The bigger gradient is, the lower the crop yield. Yields of sorghum and corn decrease by 15.44\% and 14.32\% respectively at 250 in comparison to the case of 0 degrees. In addition, yields of soya, bean and potato decrease slightly by 5.26\%, 4.67\% and 3.84\%, respectively. The influences of topographic height and slope aspect on crop yield are slight. 2) Under the same topographic condition, different crops' runoff and soil loss show obvious disparity. Topographic gradient has important influence on soil and water loss. In general, the changing trend is that the soil and water loss aggregates with the increase of gradient, and the maximal amount occurs around 20 degrees. The influence of topographic height is slight. Topographic aspect has a certain effect, and the fundamental characteristic is that values are higher at the aspect of south than north. 3) Topographic gradients of 50 and 150 are two important thresholds. The characteristic about soil and water loss with the variation of topographic gradients show that: the slope farmland with gradient less than 50 could remain unchanged, and the slope farmland more than 150 should be de-farmed as early as possible.},

Jordan's situation is emblematic, compounded by conflict-induced population shocks. Integrating knowledge across hydrology, climatology, agriculture, political science, geography, and economics, we present the Jordan Water Model, a nationwide coupled human\textendash natural-engineered systems model that is used to evaluate Jordan's freshwater security under climate and socioeconomic changes. The complex systems model simulates the trajectory of Jordan's water system, representing dynamic interactions between a hierarchy of actors and the natural and engineered water environment. A multiagent modeling approach enables the quantification of impacts at the level of thousands of representative agents across sectors, allowing for the evaluation of both systemwide and distributional outcomes translated into a suite of water-security metrics (vulnerability, equity, shortage duration, and economic well-being). Model results indicate severe, potentially destabilizing, declines in freshwater security. Per capita water availability decreases by approximately 50\% by the end of the century. Without intervening measures, {$>$}90\% of the low-income household population experiences critical insecurity by the end of the century, receiving {$<$}40 L per capita per day. Widening disparity in freshwater use, lengthening shortage durations, and declining economic welfare are prevalent across narratives. To gain a foothold on its freshwater future, Jordan must enact a sweeping portfolio of ambitious interventions that include large-scale desalinization and comprehensive water sector reform, with model results revealing exponential improvements in water security through the coordination of supply- and demand-side measures.},

Some regimes go from strength to strength, becoming more effective over the years, while others seem stymied from the beginning. Some regimes start strong, then decline; others are ineffective at first but become successful with the passage of time. In Institutional Dynamics, Oran Young offers the first detailed analysis of these developmental trajectories. Understanding the emergent patterns in environmental governance and how they affect regime effectiveness, he argues, is an important part of solving environmental problems. Young proposes a framework for analyzing patterns of institutional change based on the alignment of internal, endogenous factors--which include flexibility, monitoring procedures, and funding mechanisms--with such external, exogenous factors as the attributes of environmental problems, the political and economic contexts, and technological innovations. He offers five case studies of environmental regimes, governing environmental problems ranging from climate change to the protection of the Northern Fur Seal, each of which exemplifies one of the emergent patterns he has identified: progressive development, punctuated equilibrium, arrested development, diversion, and collapse.},

The Scheme 1987 has been in place for more than 30 years,during which time both the natural environment and the socioeconomics in the Yellow River basin have changed dramatically. Thus there is an urgent need to assess the adaptability of Scheme 1987 in changing environments. We have developed a dynamic differential equation and comprehensive evaluation model to assess water allocation scheme adaptability using power system principles. We have constructed an index system consisting of 20 metrics of sensibility,stability,resistance, and resilience and used our method to assess Scheme 1987 between 1999 and 2017. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter has been used to reveal the adaptability trend. The results show that Scheme 1987 adapted well to the changing environment, with highly adaptable years accounting for more than 63.2\% of the 19-year period. Adaptability increased early,peaking in 2005,and then decreased. The scheme began showing an inability to adapt since 2014. We have identified the major factors influencing the adaptability of Scheme 1987 and suggested some adjustments for basin-scale water resources management.},

  abstract = {An approach for nonstationary low-flow frequency analysis is developed and demonstrated on a dataset from the rivers on the Loess Plateau of China. Nonstationary low-flow frequency analysis has drawn significant attention in recent years by establishing relationships between low-flow series and explanatory variables series, but few studies have tested whether the time-varying moments of low flow can be fully described by the time-varying moments of the explanatory variables. In this research, the low-flow distributions are analytically derived from the 2 basic explanatory variablesthe recession duration and the recession coefficientwith the assumption that the recession duration and recession coefficient variables follow exponential and gamma distributions, respectively; the derived low-flow distributions are applied to test whether the time-varying moments of explanatory variables can explain the nonstationarities found in the low-flow variable. The effects of ecosystem construction measures, that is, check dam, terrace, forest, and grassland, on the recession duration and recession coefficient are further discussed. Daily flow series from 11 hydrological stations from the Loess Plateau are used and processed with a moving average technique. Low-flow data are extracted following the pit under threshold approach. Six of the 11 low-flow series show significant nonstationarities at the 5\% significance level, and the trend curves of the moments of low flow are in close agreement with the curves estimated from the derived distribution with time-dependent moments of the recession duration and time-constant moments of the recession coefficient. It is indicated that the nonstationarity in the low-flow distribution results from the nonstationarity in the recession duration in all 6 cases, and the increase in the recession duration is resulted from large-scale ecosystem constructions rather than climate change. The large-scale ecosystem constructions are found to have more influence on the decrease in streamflow than on the increase in watershed storage, thus resulting in the reduction of low flow. A high return period for the initial fixed design value decreases dramatically with an increasing recession duration.},

  abstract = {The hydrological cycle over the Yellow River has been altered by the climate change and human interventions greatly during past decades, with a decadal drying trend mixed with a large variation of seasonal hydrological extremes. To provide support for the adaptation to a changing environment, an experimental seasonal hydrological forecasting system is established over the Yellow River basin. The system draws from a legacy of a global hydrological forecasting system that is able to make use of real-time seasonal climate predictions from North American Multimodel Ensemble (NMME) climate models through a statistical downscaling approach but with a higher resolution and a spatially disaggregated calibration procedure that is based on a newly compiled hydrological observation dataset with 5 decades of naturalized streamflow at 12 mainstream gauges and a newly released meteorological observation dataset including 324 meteorological stations over the Yellow River basin. While the evaluation of the NMME-based seasonal hydrological forecasting will be presented in a companion paper to explore the added values from climate forecast models, this paper investigates the role of initial hydrological conditions (ICs) by carrying out 6-month Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) and reverse ESP-type simulations for each calendar month during 1982-2010 with the hydrological models in the forecasting system, i.e., a large-scale land surface hydrological model and a global routing model that is regionalized over the Yellow River. In terms of streamflow predictability, the ICs outweigh the meteorological forcings up to 2-5 months during the cold and dry seasons, but the latter prevails over the former in the predictability after the first month during the warm and wet seasons. For the streamflow forecasts initialized at the end of the rainy season, the influence of ICs for lower reaches of the Yellow River can be 5 months longer than that for the upper reaches, while such a difference drops to 1 month during the rainy season. Based on an additional ESP-type simulation without the initialization of the river routing model, it is found that the initial surface water state is the 01_manuscript source of streamflow predictability during the first month, beyond which other sources of terrestrial memory become more important. During the dry/wet periods, the dominance of ICs on the streamflow predictability can be extended by a month even in the rainy season, suggesting the usefulness of the ESP forecasting approach after the onset of the hydrological extreme events. Similar results are found for the soil moisture predictability but with longer influences from ICs. And the simulations indicate that the soil moisture memory is longer over the middle reaches than those over the upper and lower reaches of the Yellow River. The naturalized hydrological predictability analysis in this study will provide a guideline for establishing an operational hydrological forecasting system as well as for managing the risks of hydrological extremes over the Yellow River basin.},

Using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data from 1982 to 2015, this study investigated the dynamics of the end date of vegetation growing season (EGS) in the Yellow River basin (YRB) and quantified the impacts of both climatic and non-climatic drivers on the EGS. Our results show that the EGS was delayed by 5.6~days in the earlier period (1982\textendash 1999), and it was further delayed by another 3.4~days in the later period (2000\textendash 2015). Based on partial derivatives method, during the entire period (1982\textendash 2015), the average contributions of daytime temperature (T\textsubscript{max}), nighttime temperature (T\textsubscript{min}), precipitation and solar radiation to EGS trends across the YRB were -0.64, 1.69, 0.52, and 0.30~days/10~yr, respectively. T\textsubscript{min} was the climatic factor that provided the highest explanation of the EGS trends. However, for the two subperiods, the dominant factor controlling EGS trends has changed from T\textsubscript{min} to precipitation. Non-climatic factors were found to have a strong positive impact on the EGS after 2000 as a result of increased PM\textsubscript{2.5} concentration in the previous winter. This study provides the first quantitative insights into spatiotemporal differences in autumn phenology within a large fluvial basin context.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Rational use of broad water resources such as water footprint is essential for promoting regional sustainable development. This study developed an approach that quantified water footprint of Beijing, China based on input-output data of local production and living sectors and defined an indicator system to assess the dependency and vulnerability of regional water footprint network. Results indicated that water footprint of Beijing decreased from 1.89\texttimes 1010~m3 in 2007 to 1.61\texttimes 1010~m3 in 2012, of which the imported virtual water accounted for 33.85\% in 2007 and 26.39\% in 2012, respectively. The primary industry had the smallest total water footprint but the largest proportion of imported virtual water. The secondary industry had the largest total water footprint and a moderate proportion of imported virtual water. The tertiary industry had a moderate proportion of total water footprint and the smallest proportion of imported virtual water. Regions with 01_manuscript virtual water export to Beijing include neighboring provinces and long distance provinces. These providers exerted indirect water stress on Beijing due to their own direct water stress and industrial structure. In order to reduce the vulnerability of the water footprint network, Beijing should import virtual water-related products and services from the areas with less water stress, and at the same time, it should improve the water use efficiency of its own production and consumption. The methodology suggested in this study towards decreasing the vulnerability of the water footprint network is instructive for other regions facing water scarcity like Beijing to promote rational water resources use.},

  abstract = {The dependence of the runoff coefficient (RC) on basin size has been recognized since decades as a big challenge. However, how such region-specific scale effect varies with basin properties still remains poorly understood. This seriously limits the ability of runoff prediction in ungauged watersheds with different environments and the integrated management of watershed under climate change and land use/cover change. In this study, the scaling relationships of annual RC and its variations with basin properties were quantified based on annual precipitation and runoff data series in twenty-five sub-basins belonging to two large basins on the Loess Plateau, Northwest China. The scaling behavior of RC was found to be significant, and the mean annual RC range significantly decreased as basin size increase. And this decrease of mean annual RC was faster in areas with thin loess cover than that in areas with thick loess cover. Area thresholds, beyond which the mean RC was no longer sensitive to basin size change, were observed for the scaling behavior of annual RC and it was approximately 10,000 km(2) in thick loess areas and 25,000 km(2) in thin loess areas. This indicated that the effects of basin properties on RC scaling behavior was related with scales. Soil thickness might be one of the key basin properties that determined the scaling behavior. An exponential regression equation (R-2 = 0.71, p {$<$} 0.01) was built for the annual runoff (R) according to the corresponding geomorphic area (a(n)) and annual precipitation (P) for basins with multiple geomorphic types (n). The results imply that the basin properties not only control the form of the scaling relationships of annual RC but also limit its variations under different geomorphic conditions. These findings may help us assess and manage water resources at the basin scale more accurately.},

  abstract = {Abrupt reduction of the sediment load in the middle reaches of the Yellow River has extracted much attention during the past several decades due to global climate changes and intensive human activities. This paper investigates the spatial and temporal variations of annual sediment load in the section between Hekouzhen and Longmen in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin from 1962 to 2009 by using annual observations at 21 hydrological gauging stations (4 mainstream and 17 tributaries stations), by making use of Mann-Kendall test and simple linear regression for trend detection, and the sequential cluster analysis method and Student's t test for changing point detection. The results suggest that sediment load from both mainstream and tributaries show significant decreasing trends at confidence level of 0.01. Evident abrupt changing points are detected around 1970s for most stations, but for Toudaoguai station and Fugu station are found in the mid-1980s, which are mainly attributed to the operation of Longyangxia Dam. In addition, abrupt changes in the sediment series at some stations from the tributaries were found around the late 1990s, this situation may be resulted from the "Green for Grain" project launched in 1999. Sediment budget analysis indicates that the 17 tributaries contributes 70.60\% sediment load to the whole research area, which suggests that the majority sediment load contribution to He-Long region is from these tributaries. The comparison among three mainstream sections implies that the sediment is mainly from Wubao-Longmen section. And contribution of tributaries in each mainstream section is mainly from Huangfuchuan River, Kuye River, Wuding River and Yan River. The reduction of the sediment load is mainly caused by human activities especially soil and water conservation projects (such as afforestation, terraces, reservoirs and dams). In summary, the results in this study provide a further evidence for a more exact sediment source region and implementing soil and water conservation measures more effectively in the middle reaches of the Yellow River basin, China.

  abstract = {The Yellow River is the largest sandy river in the world with an annual transport capacity of approximately 1.6 billion tons. There is growing concern of water availability and soil erosion in this basin. Understanding the runoff regime and sediment transport in the upper Yellow River basin (UYRB), especially in the context of climate change, is crucial for sustainable water resource management and soil-water conservation. Herein, the authors attempt to quantify the response of water and sediment discharge to climate change in the UYRB. The authors employed a distributed hydrological model, i.e., the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), to simulate the runoff and sediment load under different scenarios, including climate change and detrended climate conditions. To predict the future trend, the authors designed scenarios based on downscaled forcing data from three global climate models (GCMs) which are with respect to the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). In response to the decrease in precipitation and increase in temperature from 1966 to 2009, annual runoff and sediment load have significantly decreased at a rate of -11.6 mm/decade and -1.3 Mt/decade, respectively. Precipitation plays a dominant role in reshaping these trends, with a contribution more than four times greater than that of temperature. Moreover, sediment yields may decline in the near future (2049-2064), especially during late summer and early fall. Runoff change holds substantial uncertainty owing to the different projection based on the GCMs. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

The revolutionary states which succeeded late imperial China, first the Republic of China (1911-1949), and especially the People's Republic of China (1949-present) did not change these essential features of water policy (Hucker, 1994). During the 1980's, however, China, began to move away from the planned economy and embraced the global market economy. China retained the structural central command of the national economy, its central bureaucracy, and its planning of titanic state water projects. National governments embarked upon massive water-control and water-supply projects, establishing an unprecedented national presence in distant areas. Such large-scale water development assured the arid regions of much greater and more dependable water supplies, thus attracting unprecedented economic and demographic growth. The development of large-scale irrigation since 1950s has brought higher yields and new development, but created serious water shortage problems and environmental consequences, such as dried up rivers and lakes, declining groundwater levels and land subsidence, salinization and water pollution (Jiao, 2004).},

  abstract = {PurposeDeep soil moisture has been considered to be critical for plant survival in water-limited ecosystems. The limited precipitation on the semi-arid Loess Plateau is the only water source for soil moisture and is unevenly distributed throughout the year. Characterizing the seasonal changes in deep soil moisture in relation to land use types and structures is important for the sustainability of vegetation restoration in this region.Materials and methodsA total of 27 experimental sites along seven transects were selected in the Jiegou catchment on the semi-arid Loess Plateau. These sites were covered by five land use types: native grassland, traditional farmland, abandoned farmland, and 5-year and 7-year Robinia pseudoacacia (RP) forestlands. Soil moisture measurements were conducted during three seasons (spring, summer, and fall) at soil depths of 0 to 5m in 0.2-m increments, and 2025 disturbed soil samples were collected to determine the gravimetric soil moisture content using the oven-dry method (24h at 105 degrees C). The depth-averaged soil moisture was compared among different seasons and land use types using one-way ANOVA and significance tests.Results and discussionAmong the seasons, the depth-averaged soil moisture had the following order: fall {$>$} spring {$>$} summer. In the shallow layers (above 2m), soil moisture in summer was significantly lower than that in spring and fall (p{$<$}0.05). The vertical distribution characteristics of soil moisture (0-5m) were similar among the land use types during each season but different among the seasons for each land use type. In general, the depth-averaged values of soil moisture among the land use types were on the order of native grassland {$>$} farmland {$>$} forestland. This finding indicated that afforestation drastically decreased deep soil moisture, particularly in summer. Furthermore, the different land use structures significantly influenced the spatial distribution of deep soil moisture during each season.ConclusionsThis study highlights the seasonal changes in both shallow and deep soil moisture under various land use types, which provides insights into the sustainable use of deep soil moisture and rational land use management on the semi-arid Loess Plateau of China.},

  abstract = {The emerging field of socio-hydrology is a special case of social-ecological systems research that focuses on coupled human-water systems, exploring how the hydrologic cycle and human cultural traits coevolve and how such coevolutions lead to phenomena of relevance to water security and sustainability. As such, most problems tackled by socio-hydrology involve some aspects of engineering design, such as large-scale water infrastructure, and self-organization in a broad context, such as cultural change at the population level and the hydrologic shift at the river basin or aquifer level. However, within the field of socio-hydrology, it has been difficult to find general theories that assist our understanding of the dynamics emerging from the interplay between design and selforganization, hindering generalization of phenomena between cases. We address this gap by developing insights on how the theoretical frameworks of robustness-fragility trade-off and cultural multilevel selection can inform our understanding in this regard. We apply the two theories to two cases in the Ganges Brahmaputra Delta in Bangladesh and the Kissimmee River Basin in Florida, illustrating how the two theories may provide general insights into causal mechanisms shaping the socio-hydrological phenomena observed in the two cases. Specifically, we use the two theories to address (1) the transference of system fragility across different domains due to design choices and (2) the multilevel social processes in the nested organizational hierarchy that lead to the formation or collapse of shared cultural traits. We show that these two theories, separately or taken together, can provide richer theoretical grounding for understanding socio-hydrological phenomena.},

In particular, ecological restoration program regions experienced a decrease in peak season land surface albedo exceeding 0.05. In this study, we examined the spatial and temporal patterns of variation during the peak season albedo in the Loess Plateau and analyzed its relationships with changes of anthropogenic and natural factors at the pixel level. Our analysis revealed that increasing grassland coverage due to returning rangeland to grassland could lead to a maximum albedo decrease of 0.030 in peak season. This result highlighted the human-induced land use change in driving the decreasing albedo on an annual scale. There was no significant correlation between precipitation change and albedo reduction. Precipitation could influence the spatial pattern of albedo in drought years by influencing the natural vegetation water requirement. However, the role of precipitation was not obvious in the ecological restoration program regions. This article demonstrates the substantial role that land use change could play in regional-scale albedo change and climate. Finally, some implications for the radiative forcing of land use change are discussed.},

  abstract = {Food and water are inextricably linked. With the increase of water consumption in irrigation and food growth, water shortage has become an urgent issue. Irrational cross-regional transfer of water embodied in food exacerbates water scarcity and restrict China's sustainable development. Given that, a Virtual Water-Food Nexus Model is developed to quantify the inter-provincial transfer of water embodied in food and to identify the complicated interactions between different provinces. In detail, Environmental Input-Output Analysis is applied to quantitatively estimate the inter-provincial water transfer embodied in food trades. Based on the network constructed by interrelated nature of nexus, the mutual interactions, control situation, and the dominant and weak pathways are examined through the combination of Ecological Network Analysis and Principal Component Analysis. Two new indictors water consumption intensity and water supply capacity are first performed to measure the role of each province from the supply and consume side respectively. It is revealed that interregional food transactions failed to realize water resources dispatching management. Many water-deficient regions suffered from massive virtual water losses through food exports, but water-rich areas still import large quantities of food containing virtual water. Results show that exploitation and competition dominate the ecological relationships between provinces. Agricultural GDP ratio is the indicator which most affect water consumption intensity and water supply capacity. Network-based research contributes more insights into the recognition of water management responsibilities across provinces and municipalities. These findings will provide a scientific support to adjust unreasonable allocation of water resources in China in an attempt to addressing the contradiction between food demand and water shortages.},

  abstract = {Rainwater harvesting could increase the resilience of ecosystems on the Loess Plateau and thus ensure the sustainability of livelihoods that depend on them. As such, it is a key component of strategies for adapting to global climate change. In this study, we used a new method to quantify the rainwater harvesting potential (RWHP) across the whole Loess Plateau and to characterize its spatial and temporal variation over the last four decades on the basis of the variable infiltration capacity model. It was found that that the mean RWHP of the study region was 731.10x10(8)m(3), and the average water layer thickness was 114.34mm. There is considerable scope for rainwater harvesting across the Loess Plateau as a whole, to the extent that it could potentially provide enough water to implement the Grain for Green' Project. The annual average RWHP decreased slightly from 1971 to 2010, and Hurst exponent analysis indicated that this trend will exhibit long-term persistence. The annual RWHP was highest in the southeast of the Loess Plateau and lowest in the northwest. Areas with high RWHP values tended to be clustered around the middle reach of the Yellow River. For most areas, there was no significant change between 1971 and 2010. Those areas for which there was a significant decrease in RWHP were primarily located around the upper-middle reaches of the Weihe River, the upper reach of Jinghe River, the eastern Guanzhong Plain, the Qinhe River watershed and the area around Dongsheng. Quantitative assessments of RWHP are likely to be useful for guiding the development and use of innovative rainwater harvesting technologies around the world and could help to relieve the problems caused by water shortages on the Loess Plateau while simultaneously eliminate the major cause of soil erosion.

In this study, we measured Be-7 in vegetation, soil, sediment and runoff on the northern Loess Plateau of China and analyzed its variations during the rainy season to assess the potential of the Be-7 method for documenting soil redistribution and identifying sediment sources in a wide range of environments. The results indicated that vegetation, soil, and sediment samples showed higher levels and larger variations of Be-7 activities during the rainy season. The drying plants showed Be-7 mass activity that was more than three times higher than that of living and semi-decomposed plants. Be-7 mass activity in plants and sediment was much higher than in the soil. Be-7 activity in runoff water with a few submicron suspended particles varied slightly and was far lower than in plant, soil and sediment samples. The cumulative precipitation generally determined Be-7 inventory held by plants and soil. An inverse relationship was found between the Be-7 mass activity in sediment and the sediment amount. Globally, approximate 30\% of the total Be-7 was held by plants in both the herbaceous and subshrub plots. Approximate 10\% of the total Be-7 was lost with sediment from the bare plot. A very small proportion of Be-7 (1.18\%-3.20\%) was lost with runoff, and the vast majority of Be-7 was retained in the slope soil at the end of rainy season. Vegetation cover and soil erosion significantly affected the spatial distribution and variations of the Be-7 inventory in soil, providing a necessary condition for the development of a Be-7 method to document soil erosion on slopes with vegetation.

Knowledge of the effects of vegetation types on soil water dynamics would aid in understanding the mechanisms responsible for water shortages and addressing the problem of poor long-term vegetation recovery. To evaluate the response of soil water storage (SWS) to different land use types during long-term natural vegetation succession, we examined soil moisture under different land use types (grassland, shrubland and forestland) at different times (2005 and 2014) in the Ziwuling forest region, located in the central part of the Loess Plateau, China. Our results showed that vegetation type had a significant effect on SWS in the 0-500 cm soil layer. The SWS in grassland and shrubland was significantly higher in August 2014 than in August 2005, but the pattern was reversed for forestland. In the same year, the SWS was highest in grassland, intermediate in shrubland, and lowest in forestland. SWS and SWC showed a highly significant and positive relationship in the 0-60 cm soil layers (P {$<$} 0.01), and both soil bulk density (BD) and soil totalnitrogen (TN) showed a significant relationship with SWS. In addition, the SWC and soil total porosity (TP) showed a significant positive relationship in the 0-20 cm soil layer (P{$<$}0.05). These results are expected to provide insights into land water management and inform efforts to estimate the productivity and sustainability of semiarid ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have characterized drought in terms of its impacts on ecosystem services, the mechanisms through which ecosystems support life. As a result, little is known about the implications of increased drought for resource management. This case study characterizes drought by linking climate anomalies with changes in the precipitation-runoff relationship (PRR) on the Loess Plateau of China, a water-limited region where ongoing revegetation makes drought a major concern. We analyzed drought events with drought durations {$>$}= 5 years and mean annual precipitation anomaly (PA) values {$<$}= -5\% during drought periods. The results show that continuous precipitation shifts are able to change the water balance of watersheds in water-limited areas, and multi-year drought events cause the PRR to change with a significantly decreasing trend (p {$<$} 0.05) compared to other historical records. For the Loess Plateau as a whole, the average runoff ratio decreased from 10 to 6.8 \% during 1991-1999. The joint probability and return period gradually increase with increasing of drought duration and severity. The ecosystem service of water yield is easily affected by drought events with durations equal to or greater than 6 years and drought severity values equal to or greater than 0.55 (precipitation {$<$}= 212 mm). At the same time, multi-year drought events also lead to significant changes in the leaf area index (LAI). Such studies are essential for ecosystem management in water-limited areas.},

The temporal trend analysis of precipitation showed an intensified hydrological cycle with a longer dry interval, and the substantially decreased wind speed resulted in a significant decrease in the evapotranspiration and a slight increase in the soil water content.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the soil water deficit in an apple orchard and subsequent replenishment of deep soil water after the orchard was felled. Soil water changes were quantified using the "space-for-time" method through a paired plot design. The results showed that the water storage in deep soil ({$>$}3 m in depth) began to decrease when the apple tree reached about 10 years of age. The cumulative deficit of deep soil water storage in the 3-18 m soil depth could reach about 1200 mm; however, deep soil water was so depleted that apple trees can no longer adsorb water from the deep soil when apple trees are older ({$>$}22 years old). After the apple orchard was converted to cropland, precipitation replenished the desiccated deep soil to a depth of about 7 m in the first two years, but thereafter, both water recovery amount and the advance rate of the wetting front were slowed down. After 15-16 years of recovery, soil water storage increased by 512-646 mm, accounting for 42.7-53.8\% of the total cumulative soil water deficit caused by the apple orchard. However, it will take more than 26 years for soil water to be replenished to the level of the original cropland prior to planting apple trees. The considerable water deficit after afforestation and subsequent long water recovery time following deforestation extend our understanding of the effect of deep-rooted trees on water balance at the decade scale.},

Instream flow +/- one standard deviation was adopted as the water resource management target and abrupt changes in streamflow were detected by using the Mann-Whitney U test. The results of the analysis indicated that: (1) the annual flow of the Yellow River substantially decreased after abrupt changes and the probability significantly dropped that the amount of annual streamflow satisfied the ecological instream flow requirement; and (2) the water resource management target was satisfied well after th echange point only at the Tangnaihai station, located in the upper Yellow River basin. From the upper to the lower Yellow River basins, the probability has dramatically decreased that the ecological water requirement target is satisfied.

  abstract = {In this study, the coupling effects of climate aridity and vegetation restoration on runoff and sediment yield over the Loess Plateau were examined and characterized. To take into consideration the complexity of drought, as well as the varied strengths and weaknesses of different drought measures, two drought indices are selected to identify and evaluate drought variability. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data were obtained to monitor and express spatiotemporal variations in vegetation cover. The results show that most regions of the Loess Plateau experienced increasingly severe droughts over the past 40 years, and these regions comprise the major source of the Yellow River sediment. Climatic drying initially occurred in the 19905, and became statistically significant in 2000s. The increasingly severe droughts could negatively impact surface and groundwater supplies as well as soil water storage, but may also minimize surface runoff yield, which is one of the major causes of soil erosion on the Loess Plateau. Vegetation cover on the Loess Plateau was significantly improved after the implementation of "Grain for Green" project, which were helpful for controlling severe soil erosion. With the impacts of the construction of check dams, terraces and large reservoirs, runoff and sediment yield over the Loess Plateau initially exhibited downward trends between 1970 and 1990. After 1990, with the effects of the climate warming and drying, a second sharp reduction in runoff and sediment yield occurred. The coupling effects of climate aridity and vegetation restoration have led to a third significant decrease in runoff and sediment yield over the Loess Plateau after 2000. (C) 2015 Elsevier BM.

  abstract = {Social-ecological production landscape resilience (SELPR) is a significant representation of the continuous supply capacity of landscape services. It is a quantitative assessment of the spatial-temporal evolution of SELPR under internal and external disturbances that provides a scientific basis for regional ecological environments and socio-economic development. Taking Mizhi County for the study of the Loess Plateau region, a three-dimensional (social system, ecosystem, and production system) SELPR evaluation framework was constructed. Data integration was performed using the watershed as the evaluation unit. This study quantitatively evaluated the spatial-temporal differentiation of the social-ecological production landscape (SELPs) subsystem's resilience and the total SELPR in the study area and classified the areas from the three-system resilience combination level to achieve regional development trade-offs. The results were as follows: (1) In 2009-2018, the change in the social-ecological production landscapes pattern in Mizhi County showed a significant reduction in agricultural production landscapes, relatively stable social living landscapes, and an increase in ecological landscapes; (2) in 2009-2018, the SELPR increased by 12.38\%. The spatial distribution of resilience was significantly different, showing a distribution pattern of high central and low surrounding areas; (3) the county's watershed development zones were divided into five partitions: synergistic promotion areas, ecological restoration areas, social development areas, production optimization areas, and comprehensive remediation areas. The five types of zones have a certain agglomeration effect. In addition, the 01_manuscript obstacle factors affecting the SELPR of each zone are quite different. The key issues and development directions of different types of watersheds are also proposed in this paper.},

Since 1999, large-scale revegetation activities such as Grain-to-Green Program have been implemented across China's Loess Plateau. However, negative ecohydrological consequences, including streamflow decline and soil drying have emerged. Here we estimate the equilibrium vegetation cover over the Loess Plateau based on an ecohydrological model and assess the water balance under the equilibrium and actual vegetation cover over the past decade. Results show that the current vegetation cover (0.48 on average) has already exceeded the climate-defined equilibrium vegetation cover (0.43 on average) in many parts of the Loess Plateau, especially in the middle-to-east regions. This indicates a widespread overplanting, which is found to primarily responsible for soil drying in the area. Additionally, both the equilibrium vegetation cover and soil moisture tend to decrease under future (i.e., 2011-2050) climate scenarios due to declined atmospheric water supply (i.e., precipitation) and increased atmospheric water demand (i.e., potential evapotranspiration). Our findings suggest that further revegetation on the Loess Plateau should be applied with caution. To maintain a sustainable ecohydrological environment in the region, a revegetation threshold is urgently needed to guide future revegetation activities.},

  abstract = {Suspended sediment yields (SSY) respond strongly to ecological restoration (ER) efforts, and significant improvements in SSY control have been achieved in the Loess Plateau of China. However, it remains challenging to quantify the net impacts of ER on SSY. Here, we formulate the notion of elasticity of sediment discharge, by associating SSY change to climate variability and ER over the period 1950s to 2014. All ten of the subcatchments studied experienced significant decreases in annual SSY, streamflow, and suspended sediment concentration. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that changes to both streamflow volumes and to the suspended sediment concentration versus water discharge (C-Q) relationships result in reduced SSY, so that streamflow is reduced but runs clearer. We find that two of the ER strategies resulted in weaker relative impacts of climate variability, largely by reducing streamflow (by 55\% to 75\%). Meanwhile, ER predominantly decreased SSY (by 63\% to 81\%). Regarding ER practices, (i) the predominant measure acting to reduce SSY changed, over time, from engineering to reforestation; (ii) check dams preferentially act to regulate the C-Q relationships, whereas reforestation preferentially acts to moderate streamflow. Overall, our results suggest that a combination of engineering and vegetation measures is critical to achieving high-efficiency ER. While change to the ER strategy increased the efficiency of streamflow for SSY control, the lost water discharge per unit SSY reduction increased from 5.2 to 6.4 m(3)t(-1). Conflicting demands for water necessitate that further ER should target precision management by revegetation of targeted areas in the Loess Plateau.},

Streamflow changes of 37 tributaries of the Yellow River basin during 2070-2099 were predicted related to different GCMs and climatic scenarios using Budyko framework. The results indicated that: (1) When compared to precipitation and temperature during 1960-1979, increasing precipitation and temperature are dominant during 2070-2099. Particularly, under RCP8.5, increase of 10\% and 30\% can be detected for precipitation and temperature respectively; (2) Precipitation changes have larger fractional contribution to streamflow changes than temperature changes, being the major driver for spatial and temporal patterns of water resources across the Yellow River basin; (3) 2070-2099 period will witness increased streamflow depth and decreased streamflow can be found mainly in the semi-humid regions and headwater regions of the Yellow River basin, which can be attributed to more significant increase of temperature than precipitation in these regions; (4) Distinctly different picture of streamflow changes can be observed with consideration of different outputs of GCMs which can be attributed to different outputs of GCMs under different scenarios. Even so, under RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 scenarios, 36.8\% and 71.1\% of the tributaries of the Yellow River basin are dominated by increasing streamflow.

When food production reaches its technological peak, a shortage of arable land will be the key factor that limits food production. Thus, how to increase the area of arable land without ecological damage is a problem faced by the whole world. China is the world's most populous country and a traditional agricultural country. Under the pressure of rapid socioeconomic development, China has taken measures to protect its cultivated land from environmental degradation and protect its food security. By reviewing the research literature, we found several ways to increase the area of arable land while protecting this land from damage. We found that natural resources such as marginal and degraded lands could potentially be converted into arable land while still protecting the ecological environment. However, implementation of such a strategy must account for each region's unique ecological and socioeconomic conditions, and will require both support from appropriate policies and ongoing monitoring and support.

The Number of Patches (NP), Patch Density (PD) and Landscape Diversity (SHDI), Landscape Division Index (DIVISION) increase significantly. The Largest Patch Index (LPI) and Landscape Shape Index (LSI) show overall change in the rising and falling rule. The Contagion Index (CONTAG) and Cohesion Index (COHESION) first increase, then decrease. A decreasing trend is shown by runoff and sediment. The annual runoff in 2010 was 29.76\% less than in 1960, and the annual sediment load was 84.87\% less. NP, PD, COHESION, DIVISION and SHDI have a significant negative correlation with runoff and sediment, and CONTAG and runoff sediment are positively related.

  abstract = {Numerous studies have focused on environmental changes and lacustrine ecological transitions in the modern industrial era. However, little is known about the processes of ecological transitions during early human disturbances. The current lake ecosystem state is the result of long-term integrated human influences on lakes. In this study, we present multi-proxy evidence of changes in the lacustrine environment, ecosystem, and human activities inferred from a sediment core collected from Beilianchi Lake in the southwestern Chinese Loess Plateau, to document the lacustrine ecological transitions with increasing human disturbances during the past 5000 years. Our data reveal the lacustrine ecosystem was quite stable with unchanging terrestrial versus aquatic sourced organic matter before major human disturbances (4400-1400 BP), although there was a decline in precipitation and a transition from tree-to herb-dominated vegetation. From 1400 to 300 BP, when early humans began to occupy and disturb the catchment, the lake experienced high-magnitude, centennial-to decadal-scale oscillations between aquatic and terrestrial sourced organic contributions. Thereafter, as human activities further increased, the lacustrine ecosystem finally stabilized at a state with terrestrial dominated organic matter. Our results suggest that the lake experienced large-magnitude ecological oscillations during the period of 1400 -300 BP, probably indicating the lake ecosystem retained the capability of recovery from the modest early human disturbances on the catchment. The recovery of the ecosystem to these external disturbances lasted hundreds of years with centennial to decadal scales oscillations. With further increased human influences since 300 BP, the lacustrine ecosystem probably finally shifted to another state largely deviating from its natural (climate-driven) background.

The pollen record indicates the vegetation changes from mixed deciduous coniferous forest dominated by Betula, Quercus, and Abies at 3200-2200 cal BP, to forest steppe co-dominated by trees (Betula, Quercus) and herbs (mostly Artemisia) at 2200-1100 cal BP and then to steppe-like vegetation since 1100 cal BP. A distinct vegetation type shift occurred at ca.1100 cal BP, accompanied by the increase of anthropogenic indicators (cereal-type pollen, Humulus-type pollen and Pediastrum). Human deforestation might have contributed to this abrupt shift. Micro-charcoal abundance also shows a generally increasing trend during the last 1000 years, suggesting enhanced human activities. After 1100 cal BP, two deforestation phases (1100-750 cal BP and 350 cal BP-present) and one forest expansion phase (750-350 cal BP) are identified. These phases have good correlation with historical events, suggesting that increased population pressures, flourished agriculture, and warfare are the 01_manuscript reason for these forest clearances. Anthropogenic activities appear to be the 01_manuscript controlling factor of the vegetation dynamics during the late Holocene, especially for the last 1100 years. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

The water scarcity problem in China is characterized by a mismatch between the spatial distributions of water resources, economic development and other primary factors of production, which leads to the separation of production and consumption of water-intensive products. In this paper, we quantify the scale and structure of virtual water trade and consumption-based water footprints at the provincial level in China based on a multi-regional input\textendash output model. We found that virtual water withdrawals and consumption embodied in domestic trade amounts to 184billionm3 and 101billionm3 in 2007, respectively, which is equivalent to 38\% and 39\% of national total fresh water withdrawals and consumption, respectively. Virtual water trade embodied in domestic trade is about two times as much as virtual water embodied in China's international exports. Water footprint in all four municipalities, i.e., Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing, depends heavily on virtual water inflow from other provinces. China has a north-to-south net VWT pattern which is roughly the opposite of the distribution of its water resources. In addition to water efficiency improvement measures, re-shaping the water-trade nexus can be a significant complementary tool to address local water scarcity problems.},

Sea-level correction and statistical analysis were used to eliminate the effect of sea-level fluctuations on the shoreline positions. The results revealed that the evolution of the two newborn Huanghe Delta lobes was mainly influenced by the river sediment discharges, river channel changes, course shifts, floods, droughts, and marine hydrodynamic forces. During 1976-2016, the total land gain of the two lobes was 377 km(2) according to mean-tide line, and the average epeirogenetic efficiency of river sediment discharge was 0.020 m(2)/ton, which was greatly less than that when the channels were natural. The artificial stabilization of the deltaic channels had negative impact on the land gain. Assuming no artificial adjustment to the deltaic channels, the total land gain would increase 435 km(2). The land gain of the two lobes was a function of the cumulative sediment discharges, shoreline lengths and Course Shift Bonuses under the circumstance of historical river channel changes. The critical sediment discharge maintaining the area balance of the two lobes was a function of historical shoreline lengths, which increased linearly from 61 M ton in 1976 to an average of 163 M ton during 1996-2016. In the future, there are two ways to increase the land gain under the less Huanghe sediment discharge: reducing artificial disturbance of deltaic channels and letting the river enter the sea through the southwest coast of Qingshuigou Lobe.},

  abstract = {Soil erosion causes agricultural land degradation. As one of the indispensable components of the agricultural system, unpaved roads are significant sediment sources, but road erosion is often overlooked because of the relatively small areas that roads cover. This study aims to investigate the severity of road erosion under extreme rainfall and ascertain the dominating factor. We investigated road erosion in two small watersheds after a heavy rainstorm to measure rill and gully erosion on three types of road in the field and determine the factors affecting that erosion with remote sensing images and geographic information system (GIS). Using Google images before the storm and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images after the storm, we interpreted land use and measured geomorphological and vegetation factors. In 579 road cross-sections within 63 road erosion segments found along the 10.42 km roads surveyed, the average soil loss was 804.77 t ha{$<$}\textasciicircum{$>$}-1 from 01_manuscript unpaved roads, 471.78 t ha{$<$}\textasciicircum{$>$}-1 from secondary unpaved roads, and 147.46 t ha{$<$}\textasciicircum{$>$}-1 from trails. Gully erosion predominated over rill erosion on all three types of road. The average rill erosion was 0.41, 0.17, and 0.02 cm, compared with 4.88, 3.15, and 1.05 cm of gully erosion on the 01_manuscript unpaved roads, secondary unpaved roads, and trails, respectively. The contributing area dominated over other factors associated with road erosion under heavy rainfall and could explain 84.9\% of the erosion from the road segment to which it drains based on the linear regression analysis. Furthermore, a nonlinear regression model with the contributing area and road segment gradient as predictors precisely predicted road erosion (coefficient of determination, 0.970).},

  abstract = {As an integrated result of many driving factors, significant declines in streamflow were observed in many rivers of the Loess Plateau (NW China). This can aggravate the inherent severe water shortages and threatens the regional development. Therefore, it is urgent to develop adaptive measures to regulate the water yield to ensure water security. A key step for successful implementation of such measures is to separate the response of water yield to the 01_manuscript driving factors of land management and climate change. In this study, the variation of annual streamflow, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and climatic water balance in a small catchment in the Loess Plateau (near Pingliang, Gansu province) was examined for over five decades, although the relative contribution of changes in land management and climate on the streamflow reduction were estimated. A statistically significant decreasing trend of -1.14mm y(-1) in annual streamflow was detected. Furthermore, an abrupt streamflow reduction because of construction of terraces and check-dams was identified around 1980. Remarkably, 74\% of the total reduction in mean annual streamflow can be attributed to the soil conservation measures. Based on a literature review across the Loess Plateau, we found that the impact of changes in land management and climate on annual streamflow diminished with increasing catchment size. This means that there is a dependency on catchment size for the hydrological response to environmental change. This indicates that at least at the local scale well-considered land management may help ensure the water security at the Loess Plateau. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Six sub-catchments nested in the Beiluo River basin were selected to investigate streamflow regime variations during the two project periods. The annual streamflow trends and change points were detected using a bootstrap-based Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt test. Annual streamflow (from the 1950s to 2011) exhibited significantly negative trends in five out of six catchments, varying from -0.15 to -0.30 mm/a. During the integrated soil conservation period, the annual streamflow was reduced due to high flow decreases (5\% of time exceeded), whereas in the low flows (95\%) it increased in all sub-catchments. During the Grain for Green period, the annual streamflow decreased due to daily streamflow reductions at four stations. In addition to high flow and low flow decreases at the Wuqi and Liujiahe stations during the Grain for Green period, it is significant that the low flows continuously increased. Compared with trends from the forestry area, which includes the Zhangcunyi and Huangling stations, incremental annual streamflow reductions were observed in other sub-catchments, which can be linked to ecological management. This result implies that streamflow can be moderated by appropriate management options, even in semiarid areas. It was concluded that a stable streamflow regime can be achieved in vegetated areas, and streamflow moderation is dependent on ecological management practices.},

Here, we defined riverscape SESs as networks of connected ecological and social components (nodes) to disentangle the structure and effects of SESs in Heihe River Basin (HRB) in arid regions of northwest China. Results showed the ecological network in HRB has low network density and high vertex strength. Heihe River Basin Bureau, as an emerging bridging organization, changed the SES structure and increased the matching degree of SES from 0.33 to 0.53, which has caused an obvious improvement in the downstream ecology. However, the characteristics of the ecological network demonstrated that cross-boundary management actions restricted to only the river would exacerbate local environmental pressures, such as the continued decline of groundwater in midstream regions and the potential appropriation of water for ecology by the expanding farmland in the downstream region. Our study demonstrated that network analysis could be one promising direction to untangle the complex SES and understand the relationship between SES structure and outcomes. We suggest comanaging the cross-boundary river and lands to further match the SES for basin sustainability.},

  abstract = {Conventionally, the evolutions of landscape patterns show different regularities in terms of different spatial scales. Therefore, the changes of arable land use pattern under the influence of human activities in the Loess Plateau of China also follow similar rules. To examine this assumption, we selected Per Capita Arable land Area (PCAA) as an index to indicate arable land use pattern, and Human Activity Intensity (HAI) as an index to indicate the influence of human activities. We also used land use data and demographic data at a 5-year interval from 1990 to 2015 to quantify PCAA and HAI in four different spatial scales across over the Loess Plateau region. These four scales include the whole loess Plateau region, provincial (autonomous region) scale, municipal (autonomous prefecture) scale, and county (city, district) scale. The theoretical model of arable land use pattern and the HAI calculation model were used comprehensively. We performed spatial analysis on the whole PCAA and HAI with the support of GIS geographic information technology, and conducted spatial autocorrelation analysis and Pearson's correlation analysis. We performed analysis of factor driving on the PCAA and HAI for different land-use types at the county (city, district) scale. We found that the changes in arable land use pattern of the Loess Plateau were dominated by human activities at the whole region and provincial scales from 1990 to 2015. However, at the municipal and county scales, human activities account for 60\% of the changes in land use pattern. Two interesting findings were found at the municipal and county scales: one is that with the changing rate of HAI increases, the changing rate of PCAA decreased substantially; the second is that with HAI decreases, PCAA increased significantly. Besides, the changes in arable land use pattern can be explained by the synergy effect of multiple factors of human activities. This study provides insight knowledge in understanding the drives under the change of arable land use pattern in the Loess Plateau and hopefully can provide guidance for the sustainable goal of the local and country scale planning from the management perspective.},

The project produced ecological benefits (combating desertification), social benefits (flood control), and economic benefits (harvesting water for future use) that improved the community's adaptive capacity and facilitated sustainable development. This example should inspire risk managers to seek ways to transform natural disasters into resources, thereby improving hazard management and promoting community survival and development.},

  abstract = {Groundwater is an important water resource for agricultural irrigation and industrial and domestic uses around the world, especially in arid regions. China's Yellow River Basin (YRB) is a typical arid and semiarid area where agricultural irrigation depends greatly on groundwater storage. In the YRB, a few ecological restoration projects, such as the Gain for Green project, reduced crop land over 6\% around the year 2000, consequently leading to a decline in the groundwater withdraw for irrigation. A few studies emphasized the impact of land use and land cover change on evapotranspiration, soil moisture, and surface runoff processes; however, little is known about the groundwater recovery at the basin scale. In this study, we utilized multiple data sets, including satellite remote sensing (i.e., the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, GRACE), ground observation, and simulation data from land surface modeling, to identify the trend in groundwater storage (GWS) and the roles of climate change and human activities during the period of 2005\textendash 2013. The results indicate that there was a consistent estimate for the GWS changes using GRACE and ground observations at the basin scale, indicating a substantial decrease at a rate of about -3\,mm/yr. Agricultural irrigation accounted for 61.69\% (6.15\,mm/yr) of the total groundwater consumption, decreasing by 12.6\% from 2005 to 2012. However, the groundwater consumption for industrial, domestic, and public sectors increased, and total groundwater consumption was maintained a stable level of about 10\,mm/yr. Therefore, groundwater storage did not recover despite the increased groundwater recharge and the decreased groundwater irrigation. To ease groundwater depletion, groundwater management should be concerned with water allocation for agricultural irrigation and also with industrial and domestic uses, emphasizing water saving and recycling techniques.},

  abstract = {The upper Yellow River basin is located in the new Silk Road economic belt. Fundamental to the healthy development of the Yellow River ecosystem and the security of water resources in the economic belt are the hydrological regime change that drives river ecosystem processes, or called ecological flow regimes (EFR). When developing a sustainable and ecofriendly Silk Road economic belt, the evaluation of the alteration of the EFR and an attribute analysis should receive great attention because they can provide decision makers with more information on ecological implications for balancing environmental and human water needs. The objective of this paper is to investigate the EFR variation at the Lanzhou gauge as the control section of the upper Yellow River basin. First, the paper addresses the macroscale EFR using ecoflow metrics (ecodeficit and ecosurplus), i.e., the multi-year trend of the annual and seasonal changes in ecological flow. Second, it evaluates microscale variations in EFR via the Yellow River ecohydrological index system and compares them with macroscale changes in EFR to verify their consistency. Third, it analyzes the attributes of EFR variation and determines the impact of the construction and operation of reservoirs on the variation. Results show that macro-and microscale EFR at the Lanzhou gauge have significant changes before and after the construction of reservoirs in the upper Yellow River basin, reaching a high degree of alteration. Reservoir construction and operation have been the major reason for the alteration of EFR in the past few decades, and the cascade reservoir regulation has more significantly affected the changes in EFR than has a single reservoir, placing the downstream fluvial ecological system under serious risk. This change should arouse considerable concern, particularly in the development of the new Silk Road economic belt. In addition, ecoflow metrics used for reflecting the macroscale change in this study are highly correlated with microscale indicators of EFR that are accepted in the upper Yellow River basin. This result implies that ecoflow metrics can mirror most ecological information from these microscale indicators and are suitable for the evaluation of alterations in hydrological processes at annual and seasonal timescales.},

  abstract = {Water shortages have become one of the most severe problems in semi-arid regions throughout the world. Although semi-arid regions have always been dry, human activities and climate change are acerbating the problem. In Chinese Yellow River basin, the river is the major source of freshwater for those living there, and they have long suffered from serious water shortages. However, increasing population and decreasing streamflow are making these shortages more acute. This study seeks to quantify changes in available water in the Yellow River basin over the last 100 years and attempts to determine causes for these changes. To do this, the study evaluated changing trends and regime shifts of streamflow using long term historical records at different hydrological stations in the Yellow River basin over the past century. The results show that annual streamflow has a significant decreasing trends (P {$<$} 0.01) in the mid-lower reaches of the basin. Streamflow decomposition by the breaks for additive seasonal and trend approach suggest that this trend can be decomposed into four distinct annual stages (1919-1933, 1934-1969, 1970-1986 and 1987-2011), while the seasonal component demonstrated an evident regime shift in 1986. This regime shift is mainly related to the construction of large reservoirs in the basin. The flow duration curves illustrate a decrease in the magnitude of streamflow over the last century with a relatively uniform flow regime at all stations. The reconstructed streamflow at Toudaoguai station suggests that agricultural irrigation is predominantly responsible for streamflow reductions between Lanzhou and Toudaoguai stations with approximately 9.1 km(3)/a of water extracted between 1997 and 2006. Meanwhile, a decrease of incoming water from upper reaches and soil and water conservation measures were responsible for the significant decline in annual streamflow at mid-lower reaches station. The result of this paper should be of use for water resources planning, watershed management and climate adaptation as they demonstrate how natural and anthropogenic drivers influence water availability in semi-arid regions.},

  abstract = {Water allocation can be undertaken through administered systems (AS), market-based systems (MS), or a combination of the two. The debate on the performance of the two systems has lasted for decades but still calls for attention in both research and practice. This paper compares water users' behavior under AS and MS through a consistent agent-based modeling framework for water allocation analysis that incorporates variables particular to both MS (e.g., water trade and trading prices) and AS (water use violations and penalties/subsidies). Analogous to the economic theory of water markets under MS, the theory of rational violation justifies the exchange of entitled water under AS through the use of cross-subsidies. Under water stress conditions, a unique water allocation equilibrium can be achieved by following a simple bargaining rule that does not depend upon initial market prices under MS, or initial economic incentives under AS. The modeling analysis shows that the behavior of water users (agents) depends on transaction, or administrative, costs, as well as their autonomy. Reducing transaction costs under MS or administrative costs under AS will mitigate the effect that equity constraints (originating with primary water allocation) have on the system's total net economic benefits. Moreover, hydrologic uncertainty is shown to increase market prices under MS and penalties/subsidies under AS and, in most cases, also increases transaction, or administrative, costs.},

Experiments were conducted on grass, root and bare slopes, with sandy soil from a water-wind crisscrossed erosion region of the Loess Plateau, China. A. adsurgens coverage on grass slopes was approximately 40\%. There were three rainfall intensities of 30, 60 and 90mmh(-1) and four slope gradients of 3, 6, 9 and 12 degrees. A. adsurgens had a significant effect on soil erosion control; soil loss was reduced by similar to 70\% on slopes with the grass compared with bare slopes. The grass roots reduced soil loss more than its canopy, particularly in high-intensity rainfall, which reduced soil loss by 82\%. The presence of the grass and its roots changed the soil erosion process, reducing soil erodibility (K-r) and increasing the critical shear stress ((c)). The soil erosion rate on the bare slope increased steadily over time; on the grass and root slopes, its rate initially increased, then decreased and then finally stabilized. K-r on the grass and root slopes was reduced by 96\% and 89\%, respectively, compared with the bare slope, while the corresponding (c) increased by 92\% and 195\% respectively. These results provide insights into the mechanisms of grass on soil and water conservation and may help to improve vegetation construction in water-wind crisscrossed erosion regions of the Loess Plateau.

As a result of climate change, deforestation and sparse vegetative cover, the region suffers from water shortages and severe soil erosion, significantly influencing efforts for sustainable social development. In order to understand the impacts of climatic variability and human activities on runoff and other hydrological factors in this region, the Luoyugou catchment and its paired catchments (Qiaozidong and Qiaozixi) were selected. Statistical analysis indicated precipitation did not vary significantly whereas the annual runoff decreased from 1986 to 2008, with an abrupt change in 1994. Actual evapotranspiration (AET) increased slightly but not significantly. A comparison of runoff in the paired catchments showed land use changes reduced runoff by more than 38\% under the same rainfall conditions. Human activities were the strongest contributor to changes in runoff and AET, at 67\% and 90\% respectively, while the remaining contributor was climate variation. The influence of various human activities on runoff is quite different, and soil-water conservation initiatives have a greater impact on runoff (about 41\%). Thus, human activities were the primary reason for the reduction in runoff in the study catchment compared to climate. Greater emphasis should be given to afforestation and soil-water conservation measures.},

Information on regional spatial pattern of soil water storage (SWS) and its relationship with environmental factors is important for optimal water management and vegetation restoration in China's Loess Plateau (CLP) region. State-space approach and artificial neural network (ANN) were used to analyze spatial variability of SWS in the CLP region. SWS in the 0-1, 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, and 4-5 m soil layers was measured during the period from June 2013 to September 2015 at 86 locations along a 860 km long south-north transect of CLP. The analysis showed that SWS in the 5 m soil profile generally decreased with increasing latitude, driven by decreasing precipitation and soil-water holding capacity. Using various combinations of variables, the state-space model gave a better spatial pattern of SWS than the ANN approach. The best state-space approach, which included clay content, mean annual precipitation, and slope gradient, explained 96.0\% of the total variation in SWS. Then, the best ANN approach explained only 76.2\% of the variation. Clay content, mean annual precipitation, and slope gradient was the most effective combination for large-scale estimation of SWS under the state-space approach. The state-space model was recommended as an effective method for analyzing large-scale spatial patterns of soil water using soil, climatic, and topographic properties in the CLP region.},

In this study, we present the first sediment core record from Lake Gyaring, one of the largest fresh lakes in SRYR, using proxies of total organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, delta C-13(org), chlorophyll a, and grain size, to discuss the environmental variations over past 10 kyr. The results show that sedimentary organic matter mainly originated from the aquatic macrophytes and phytoplankton, the relative abundance of which can serve as a qualitative indicator of lake level changes of Lake Gyaring. From 10 to 6.2 cal kyr B.P., the notable expansion of macrophytes was favored by the warm conditions and an enlarged littoral zone due to lake-level decline. The abrupt cooling between 8.9 and 8 cal kyr B.P. led to temporal lake-level rises that significantly reduced macrophyte primary production. After 6.2 cal kyr B.P., the lake turned to be phytoplankton-dominated following the cooling trend and stepwise increase in lake level. The inferred climate pattern in the lake catchment with an overall dry early to mid Holocene and moister mid to late Holocene disagrees with the Asian monsoon variations. This phenomenon is well recognized by the lake-level records from most of the northeastern TP lakes, implying that strong evaporation in semi-arid lake catchments could have outweighed the increased regional precipitation during early to mid Holocene and vice versa for mid to late Holocene.},

  abstract = {Despite a multitude of studies, overall erosion rates as well as the contribution of different erosion processes on Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) remain uncertain, which hampers a correct assessment of the impact of soil erosion on carbon and nutrient cycling as well as on crop productivity. In this paper we used a novel approach, based on field evidence, to reassess erosion rates on the CLP before and after conservation measures were implemented (1950 vs. 2005). We found that current average topsoil erosion rates are 3 to 9 times lower than earlier estimates suggested. Under 2005 conditions, more sediment was produced by nontopsoil erosion (gully erosion (0.23 +/- 0.28 Gt yr(-1)) and landsliding (0.28 +/- 0.23 Gt yr(-1)) combined) than by topsoil erosion (ca. 0.30 +/- 0.08 Gt yr(-1)). Overall, these erosion processes mobilized ca. 4.77 +/- 1.96 Tg yr(-1) of soil organic carbon (SOC): the latter number sets the maximum magnitude of the erosion-induced carbon sink, which is ca. 4 times lower than one other recent estimate suggests. The programs implemented from the 1950s onwards reduced topsoil erosion from 0.51 +/- 0.13 to 0.30 +/- 0.08 Gt yr(-1) while SOC mobilization was reduced from 7.63 +/- 3.52 to 4.77 +/- 1.96 TgC yr(-1). Conservation efforts and reservoir construction have disrupted the equilibrium that previously existed between sediment and SOC mobilization on the one hand and sediment and SOC export to the Bohai sea on the other hand: nowadays, most eroded sediments and carbon are stored on land. Despite the fact that average topsoil losses on the CLP are still relatively high, a major increase in agricultural productivity has occurred since 1980. Fertilizer application rates nowadays more than compensate for the nutrient losses by (topsoil) erosion: this was likely not the case before the dramatic rise of fertilizer use that started around 1980. Hence, erosion is currently not a direct threat to agricultural productivity on the CLP but the long-term effects of erosion on soil quality remain important.},

The plausible monotonic trend of annual climatic time series are detected using a non-parametric method. The abrupt changes have been investigated in terms of a 5 year moving averaged annual series, using the moving t-test (MTT) method. Yamamoto method and Mann-Kendall method. The results showed that the annual air temperature has increased by 0.80 degrees C in the headwater catchment of the Yellow River basin during the past 42 years. One obvious cold period and one warm period were detected. The warmest centre was located in the northern part of the basin. The long-term trend for annual precipitation was not significant during the same period, but a dry tendency was detected. According to the Kendall slope values, the declining centre for annual precipitation was located in the eastern part and the centre of the study area. The long-term monotonic trend for annual sunshine duration and pan evaporation were negative. The average Kendall slopes are -29.96 h/10 yr and -39.63 mm/10 yr, respectively. The tests for abrupt changes using MTT and Yamamoto methods show similar results. Abrupt changes occurred in the mid 1980s for temperature, in the late 1980s for precipitation and in the early 1980s for sunshine duration and pan evaporation. It can be seen that the abrupt changes really happened in the 1980s for sunshine duration and pan evaporation. It can be seen that the abrupt changes really happened in the 1980s for the climate variables. Different results are shown using the Mann-Kendall method. Both the abrupt changes of temperature and precipitation took place in the early 1990s, and that of pan evaporation occurred in the 1960s. The only abrupt change is sunshine duration happened during the similar period (in the 1980s) with the results detected by the MTT and Yamamoto methods. The abrupt changes which occurred in the 1990s and 1960s are not detectable using the MTT and Yamamoto methods because of the data limitation. However, the results tested by the MTT and Yamamoto method exhibited great consistency. Some of the reasons may be due to the similar principles for these two methods. Different methods testing the abrupt climatic changes have their own merits and limitations and should be compared based on their own assumption and applicable conditions when they are used.

Significant changes in streamflow have been detected; these changes result in part from large number of soil and water conservation measures implemented over the past six decades in this area. This study investigates streamflow variations and evaluates the impacts of climate variability and human activity on the mean annual flow in the MRYRB. The non-parametric Mann-Kendall test and Pettitt's test are applied to characterize the trends and abrupt changes of hydro-climatic variables in the MRYRB. The analysis was performed on streamflow data taken over the period from the 1950s to 2010 at 18 hydrological stations and on precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration (PET) data from 43 climate stations. We find that 16 of these stations recorded significant decreases in annual streamflow, with reduction rates ranging from 0.10 mm/yr to 1.61 mm/yr over the study period. Precipitation at all of the stations also had negative trends, with changes ranging from -4.7 mm/yr to -0.19 mm/yr. Temperature increased significantly at most stations, while PET showed a mixed of upward and downward trend. Abrupt changes in streamflow at mainstream stations occurred when large reservoirs were built, while breakpoints of streamflow at tributary stations were mainly driven by the implementation of soil and water conservation measures. We used both Budyko's curve (a simple water balance model) and linear regression to evaluate the potential impacts of climate variability and human activities on mean annual streamflow. Climate variability has a greater effect on the streamflow reduction in the Beiluo River and Yan River, while human activities accounted for more of the streamflow changes in other tributaries, especially in the northern catchments. In general, human activities, including soil and water conservation projects, the operation of dams and reservoirs, and water consumption, are found to be the dominant factors responsible for the significant decline in the annual streamflow in the MRYRB over the last six decades.

Materials and methods In this study, the runoff and sediment transportation data from 1960 to 2016, from hydrological stations (Wenjiachuan, Baijiachuan, Ganguyi, and Zhuangtou) based in four typical basins, were analyzed systematically using linear regression, anomaly accumulation, the Mann-Kendall test, and double accumulation curve. The characteristics of the runoff and sediment transportation and their responses to climatic and anthropogenic activities were investigated using several hydrological analytical and statistical methods. Results and discussion The results indicate that both runoff and sediment transportation in the four typical basins have decreased sharply from 1960 to 2016. Since the implementation of the Grain-for-Green Project in 1999, the reduction has been more marked, in particular the runoff and sediment discharge of the Kuye River (Wenjiachuan station). Compared with the period 1960-1999, the average annual runoff and sediment discharge in 2000-2016 had decreased by 76.72\% and 94.50\%, respectively. Apart from the Wuding River (Baijiachuan station), an abrupt change in runoff and sediment transportation in the basins occurred within 2-7 years of the implementation of the Grain-for-Green Project. Conclusions In general, returning farmland to forests (grass) has had a more pronounced effect on the reduction of runoff and sediment in the more northerly Kuye River (Wenjiachuan station) and Wuding River (Baijiachuan station) basins, compared with the more southerly Yanhe River (Ganguyi station) and Beiluo River (Zhuangtou station) basins.},

The present paper reviewed the historical variation of climate, vegetation cover, and environment changes in order to understand the causes of severe soil erosion. Documentary evidence indicated that climate changes and vegetation cover were the dominant natural factors influencing the soil erosion rates during the Holocene. Intensive human activities consisting of warfare, population growth, deforestation, and soil and water conservation measures were responsible for the changes of soil erosion during the anthropogenic period. Spatial and temporal changes of specific sediment yields presented significant decrease within the last several decades, which resulted from decreasing rainfall, large scale soil and water conservation measures, agricultural irrigation, and reservoir construction. Different phase of soil conservation measures demonstrated the development of policies and techniques on soil erosion control. Effective strategies of soil and water conservation, consisting of terracing, afforestation, natural rehabilitation, and check-dams construction, were carried out on the Loess Plateau during the past six decades. The progress of soil conservation measures confirmed that the check-dams systems might be suitable for Loess hilly Plateau, and natural vegetation rehabilitation is the best way for soil erosion control and should be implemented in other regions with emphasis of improving the quality of conservation measures based on natural rehabilitation.

An investigation of the characteristics of SWS at large regional scales can provide valuable information. We measured SWS and available soil-water storage (ASWS) to a depth of 5 m along a 500-km transect across two climatic regions on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). SWS5 m tended to decrease from southeast to northwest and was 320 mm higher in the subhumid than the semiarid zone. SWS5 m and ASWS(5 m) were lower in the dry than the rainy season, but SWS1 m and ASWS(1 m) did not differ significantly between the two seasons except in the 0-100 cm layer. SWS1 m and ASWS(1 m) tended to increase with depth in the semiarid zone and did not change substantially with depth in the subhumid zone. SWS5 m and ASWS(5 m) varied with land use, in the orders cropland {$>$} orchard {$>$} forest in the subhumid zone and grassland {$>$} shrubland {$>$} forest in the semiarid zone. Climatic conditions and soil textures were predominant factors affecting SWS at the transect scale. SWS5 m and ASWS(5 m) in the subhumid zone were dependent on clay content, elevation, latitude and the interaction of latitude and temperature, while clay content played a dominant role in the semiarid Zone. Understanding this information is helpful for assessing regional water resources, optimizing the rational use of land and modeling eco-hydrological processes on the CLP and possibly in other water-limited regions around the world.

  abstract = {Analyses of the spatial and temporal variation of reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and aridity index (AI) can further understand climate change and its effect on hydrology. In this study, based on date from 58 standard meteorological stations, the spatio-temporal variations and trends of ET0 and AI were calculated for the Loess Plateau Region (LPR) from 1961 to 2012 using the Mann-Kendall test, the moving t-test, and the Morlet wavelet methods. The results demonstrated: (1) the annual ET0 displayed a statistically significant decrease of -10.3 mm/10 y (P {$<$} 0.05) during 1961-2012. At that time, AI also had a decreasing trend of -0.013/10 y over the past 52 years. Compared with ET0, the inter-decadal variations of AI over the LPR seemed to show similar declined trends. (2) Spatially, about 81\% stations displayed a decreasing trend for annual ET0 during 1961-2012, and most of them were distributed in the western, northern and southeastern LPR. In addition, about 60\% of stations showed statistically decreasing trends for AI, and the major decreases were mainly in the east Qinghai division and northern LPR. (3) Abrupt changes were detected in annual ET0 series in the 1980s and in annual AI series in 1987. Wavelet analysis indicated significant 2 year and non-significant 7, 10 and 14 years in annual ET0 series, and there existed periods of 4, 8 and 12 years for AI. (4) For ET0, wind speed was the most sensitive meteorological factor, followed by sunshine hours, precipitation, and relative humidity. For AI, ET0 and precipitation were the sensitive factors. This study provides an understanding of the effect of recent climate change on hydrological cycle in the LPR. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Variation of streamflow and sediment load in the Yellow River basin has received considerable attention due to its drastic reduction during the past several decades. This paper presents a detailed investigation on the changes of streamflow and sediment load from 1952 to 2011 using monthly observations at four gauging stations along the Yellow River. The results show significant decreasing trends for both streamflow and sediment load at all four gauging stations over the past 60 years. The wavelet transform demonstrated discontinuous periodicities from 1969 to 1973 and after 1986 due to the construction of large reservoirs and implementation of numerous soil and water conservations practices. The sediment rating curves with the power-law function was applied to investigate the relationship between discharge and sediment load. The results indicate distinct variations of the relationship between streamflow and sediment and implied significant hydro-morphological changes within different periods. The reducing sediment supply from the source region and the increased erosive power of the river are detected at Lanzhou station, while the decrease of the transport capacity at Toudaoguai is caused by severe siltation. Significant changes in the relationship between streamflow and sediment load are found at Huayuankou and Gaocun stations, which are largely induced by evident sediment income and trapping effects of large reservoirs. It is estimated that numerous reservoirs have strongly altered the regime and magnitude of streamflow and trapped large amount of sediment, leading to severe siltation and evident reduction of their total volumes. A decrease in precipitation, incoming water from the upper reaches, soil and water conservation measures as well as water consumption contribute most to the significant reduction of streamflow. The decrease of sediment load mainly resulted from various soil and water conservation measures and trapping in reservoirs from 1986 to 2011.},

The chronology of an 11-m-long sediment core was controlled by 19 accelerator mass spectrometry radiocarbon dates on terrestrial plant macrofossils. The pollen record shows a long-term change from a closed canopy forest to open landscape over the last 6200 years: from mixed deciduous-coniferous forest dominated by Betula, Quercus, Picea and Pinus at 6200-2900 cal yr BP, to transitional steppe forest co-dominated by trees (Betula. Picea and Pious) and herbs (mostly Arternisia) at 2900-1100 cal yr BP, and to open landscape dominated by Artemisia and Poaceae after 1100 cal yr BP. This general pattern of vegetation change indicates a drying climate trend, consistent with other independent climate records mostly from the monsoon region that show a weakening summer monsoon since the mid-Holocene. The gradual increase in both Poaceae pollen and microscopic charcoal since about 2000 cal yr BP and a sharp increase in Poaceae but a decrease in charcoal at 1000 cal yr BP indicate two phases of human impacts on vegetation. The results from pollen and charcoal analysis, together with archaeological and historical evidence, suggest that human activities over the last 2000 years have significantly accelerated deforestation that was initiated by a drying climate since the mid-Holocene.

Geostatistical and trend analyses are used to study the LUCC characteristics, driving forces and environmental effects, and the relationship between LUCC and regional sustainable development is explored. The following results were obtained: (1) Overall, the land use structure has not changed, with grassland, farmland, and forest land remaining dominant; however, the vegetation coverage has significantly increased, especially in the central area. (2) LUCC is affected by climate change and human activities, with greater climate change impacts in the northwest than the southeast and greater among which human-induced impacts on the hilly/gully region in the central part. (3) LUCC will produce long-term ecological and environmental processes, such as surface runoff, soil erosion, soil moisture and carbon cycling. Vegetation restoration has both negative and positive effects on the regional ecological environment. Vegetation productivity on the Loess Plateau has approached the water resource carrying capacity threshold. Therefore, improving artificial vegetation stability and promoting the water resources balance have become the 01_manuscript strategies for promoting sustainable development on the Loess Plateau.},

  abstract = {The Water Erosion Prediction Project (WEPP) model has been extensively evaluated at lower slope gradients, but its applicability to steep slopes is not yet known. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the WEPP model's ability to predict runoff and soil erosion on steep slopes in the hilly-gully region of the Loess Plateau of China, and to provide insights for adapting it for this region. Field runoff and soil loss data collected from six bare slope gradient plots, four bare slope length plots, and four cropped plots at the Ansai experimental station during 1985-1992 were used to calibrate, validate, and evaluate the WEPP hillslope model. Measured rainfall intensity (rainfall break point data) was directly used to minimize climate-induced prediction errors. Overall, the calibrated WEPP model predicted event, annual, and average annual runoff and soil loss for different slope gradients, slope lengths, and cropped conditions reasonably well with model efficiencies (E-NS) being greater than 0.5 for most cases, but there is still room for improvement. Specifically, for the slope gradient plots, simulated runoff was somewhat insensitive to slope increases at large slope gradients while measured runoff tended to increase with slope steepness due to a decrease in surface storage capacity; however, simulated average annual soil loss, though satisfactory (E-NS = 0.83), was slightly oversensitive to slope increases at large slope gradients. For the slope length plots, simulated average annual soil loss was overly responsive to slope length increases at steep slopes, indicating a potential deficiency in representing slope length influence in the model for large slope gradients. The use of the default 1-m rill spacing might have also affected the sensitivity of WEPP-predicted soil loss to slope gradients and lengths, because rill spacing varies with slope steepness and lengths and WEPP-predicted erosion is sensitive to rill spacing. For the cropped plots, WEPP tended to underpredict runoff and soil loss, indicating that the internal model adjustments of hydraulic conductivity and soil erodibility for the effects of factors like roots and residue need to be reexamined for use on steep slopes.},

  abstract = {The maximum river flow is of important reference significance to flood disaster prevention on the Loess Plateau of central China. However, due to the lack of hydrological data, previous studies have rarely explored spatiotemporal changes in the annual maximum daily runoff depth (Hmax) and annual maximum daily suspended sediment yield (SSYmax) of rivers in this region. This study uses daily discharge data and daily sediment concentration data from 104 hydrological stations on the plateau to compare the Hmax and the SSYmax during period P1 (1971-1987) and period P2 (2008-2016). The results show that 66\% of stations exhibited a significant decline in multi-year mean Hmax from P1 to P2 (p {$<$} 0.05). However, the multi-year mean SSYmax showed more widespread changes, with 77\% of stations seeing a significant decline (p {$<$} 0.05). And on average, the runoff on the day of Hmax contributed 6.6\% and 5.8\% of the annual runoff during P1 and P2, respectively; by contrast, SSYmax contributed 27.9\% and 33.5\%, respectively, to the total annual suspended sediment yield in P1 and P2. Analyses using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient indicate that the spatial distribution of Hmax has larger variability than SSYmax during both P1 and P2 and that the spatial distribution pattern of SSYmax during P2 is more unstable than during P1. We found that the suspended sediment concentration (SSC) on the day that Hmax occurs (SSChmax) remained relatively stable for most stations studied within the loess gullied-hilly area across the Loess Plateau, but the stable SSChmax value during P1 differed from the value during P2. We conclude that human activities (e.g., afforestation, terracing, and construction of check dams) may be the cause of the differing SSC values during peak discharge between the two periods. We also found that the average percentage of years in which Hmax and SSYmax occurred on the same day on the plateau was 55\%. Many factors can lead to Hmax and SSYmax happening asynchronously, such as heavy runoff events lasting several consecutive days, the characteristics of a particular basin, and the influence of human activities. These results provide information that will be useful for understanding how to manage extreme hydrological events on the Loess Plateau.},

  abstract = {Exclusion of non-erosive rainfalls is highly desirable in calculating the rainfall erosivity. It is common practice to use a rainfall threshold to separate erosive from non-erosive events. This study aims to determine erosive events in the Chinese Loess Plateau using the runoff threshold. The data used mainly include h (runoff depth; total runoff volume normalized to drainage area) and specific sediment yield (SSY) of 1475 storm events observed at three scales of hillslope, subwatershed, and watershed. The linear h-SSY relationships (SSY = bh + a) were established. The x-intercept term (-a/b) was interpreted to be the h threshold between erosive and non-erosive events. The t test was used to test whether the constant term a is statistically zero or not. The t tests demonstrated that the h-SSY relationship was proportional on upland slopes, but linear with a positive x-intercept in subwatersheds and watersheds. Accordingly, the h threshold of erosive events varied from zero on upland slopes, implying that any runoff event is erosive, to a positive value in subwatersheds and watersheds. The positive h threshold can be related to the preferential generation of runoff on the bedrock channel at the subwatershed scale and to the base flow at the watershed scale. Using the h threshold can remove approximately 85\% of rainfall events from the calculation of rainfall erosivity. The h threshold not only is equally effective as the rainfall threshold in removing non-erosive events but also allows a more accurate estimation of rainfall erosivity.},

  abstract = {Little information is available on the scale behavior of the flow-sediment relationship despite numerous studies on the scale behavior of sediment yield. Based on data observed at 19 gauging stations and 10 runoff experimental plots, we examined the flow-sediment relationship in the context of spatio-temporal scales for hilly loess areas, China. Distinct from many rivers around the world, sediment concentration in runoff is totally independent of flow discharge at any spatial scale for hilly loess areas. At the intra-event timescale, the relationship between flow discharge and sediment discharge can be well fitted by a proportional function especially at the entire slope (a combination of the hill slope and the channel side slope) and the larger scale. At the inter-event timescale, the variability of mean sediment concentration for a single runoff event decreases dramatically with increasing spatial scale. Accordingly, the proportional model of event runoff volume and sediment yield proposed in Zheng et al. (2007a and 2008) is applicable over a wide range of spatial scales from the hill slope to the large-sized watershed (up to 110, 000 km(2)). Both proportional models of the intra- and inter-event timescales are corroborated by the nonlinear regression technique, which yields a power fit with an exponent extremely close to 1. In a fully physical sense, however, the runoff-sediment yield relationship at the watershed scale should be linear with a negligible constant term due to the presence of base flow. At the annual timescale, the relationship between annual runoff volume and annual sediment yield at the watershed scale becomes linear with an indispensable constant term due to the higher proportion of base flow. The widely used power function is inappropriate for fitting the flow-sediment relationship in hilly loess areas at any spatio-temporal scales we examined. A comparable result was also obtained for the Walnut Gulch Experimental watershed of USA, suggesting that the proportional model may be universal for regions where sediment supply is sufficiently available.

  abstract = {Selection enhances mutation toleration Mutations generate variability that is either neutral or subject to natural selection. Robustness is a measure of the ability to withstand deleterious mutational effects. Zheng et al. exposed Escherichia coli populations expressing a yellow fluorescent protein to strong, weak, or no selection for yellow fluorescence for four generations. They then selected these populations to a related function, green fluorescence, for four more generations. The strong selection first for yellow and then green fluorescence resulted in the most green fluorescence and the accumulation of the most mutations. This outcome likely was due to the increased foldability of the protein. Selection thus provides a threshold for mutation accumulation, but robustness maintains a buffer necessary for protein evolution. Science, this issue p. eabb5962 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONNatural selection plays a central role in adaptive evolution, but we still know little about its role in changing evolvability\textemdash the ability to bring forth new and adaptive phenotypes. Different kinds of selection may increase evolvability by different means. Weak purifying selection may enhance evolvability by promoting the accumulation of neutral or slightly deleterious mutations that can serve as stepping stones toward new phenotypes. By contrast, strong directional selection may enhance evolvability by favoring the accumulation of beneficial mutations that can enhance both fitness and evolvability, such as mutations that increase a protein's thermodynamic stability or its robustness to mutations. RATIONALETo find out how the strength of selection affects protein evolvability, we subjected populations of yellow fluorescent proteins to multiple rounds of directed evolution in Escherichia coli. To control the strength of selection with precision, we used high-throughput phenotypic screening via fluorescence-activated cell sorting. During a first phase of our experiment (phase I), we subjected our populations to either strong selection, weak selection, or no selection on the ancestral phenotype of yellow fluorescence. During the second phase (phase II), we evolved all populations under the same selection pressure toward the new phenotype of green fluorescence. We subsequently used high-throughput phenotypic screening to study how phenotypes evolved in all our populations. In every generation, we also studied genotypic evolution with single-molecule real-time sequencing. We then engineered key adaptive mutants and determined their phenotype and thermodynamic stability. In addition, we determined the robustness of their phenotype to DNA mutations. Furthermore, we quantified the foldability of these mutants by unfolding them and observing their refolding kinetics. RESULTSWe found that populations under strong selection for the ancestral yellow fluorescent phenotype during phase I subsequently evolved the new green fluorescent phenotype most rapidly during phase II. Compared to populations under weak or no selection, they reached higher green fluorescence during each generation of phase II and evolved a green emission peak more rapidly. Strong selection promoted both the elimination of deleterious mutations and the accumulation of foldability-improving mutations. As a result, proteins under strong selection evolved higher efficiency of protein folding (foldability) and, to an even greater extent, higher robustness to mutations than proteins under weak or no selection. Their robustness and foldability accelerated the selective sweeps of neofunctionalizing mutations that are necessary to evolve a new phenotype. By contrast, proteins under weak selection accrued more deleterious mutations that slowed down the fixation of neofunctionalizing mutations during the evolution of the new phenotype, even though neofunctionalizing mutations had initially risen to higher frequencies under weak selection. CONCLUSIONStrong directional selection enhances the evolvability of a new phenotype to a greater extent than weak purifying selection. The responsible mutations enhance tolerance to mutations, improve protein foldability, and thus increase accessibility of a protein's native state. In doing so, they promote the formation of correctly folded states that can display new functions after incorporating neofunctionalizing mutations. Although ``first order'' selection of fitness-enhancing mutations can be in conflict with ``second-order'' selection of evolvability-enhancing mutations, our experiments demonstrate a class of mutations that avoid this conflict, because the mutations they reveal enhance both fitness and evolvability. In the context of an adaptive landscape (see figure), they do so by circumnavigating rather than traversing adaptive valleys, passing through flat regions of such a landscape, and thus allowing an evolving population to climb a new adaptive peak more rapidly. More generally, our experiments prove that natural selection itself can create the conditions under which Darwinian evolution can succeed. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/370/6521/eabb5962/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Selection can drive evolvability.Evolutionary theory holds that Darwinian evolution takes place on adaptive landscapes of fitness, which can be visualized as topological maps of high-fitness peaks and low-fitness valleys. This hypothetical landscape illustrates how mutations can increase evolvability by enhancing both fitness and mutational robustness. Favored by strong selection because they enhance fitness, such mutations move an evolving population into a region of low curvature and high robustness (red arrow), from which the population can bypass rather than traverse (blue arrow) an adaptive valley on its way to an adaptive peak. Natural selection can promote or hinder a population's evolvability\textemdash the ability to evolve new and adaptive phenotypes\textemdash but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To examine how the strength of selection affects evolvability, we subjected populations of yellow fluorescent protein to directed evolution under different selection regimes and then evolved them toward the new phenotype of green fluorescence. Populations under strong selection for the yellow phenotype evolved the green phenotype most rapidly. They did so by accumulating mutations that increase both robustness to mutations and foldability. Under weak selection, neofunctionalizing mutations rose to higher frequency at first, but more frequent deleterious mutations undermined their eventual success. Our experiments show how selection can enhance evolvability by enhancing robustness and create the conditions necessary for evolutionary success. Directed evolution of yellow fluorescent protein into green fluorescent protein shows how selection can improve functional evolvability. Directed evolution of yellow fluorescent protein into green fluorescent protein shows how selection can improve functional evolvability.},

A clear and stable water rights system is necessary for sustaining world's agricultural productions and global food security. However, knowledge gap still exists on identifying the critical 01_manuscript and their interactions in the water rights system in the context of changing environments. This paper establishes a systematic framework of water rights based on the current practices in China. The relationships among water rights, water entitlements, water-abstraction permits, water rights certificates and seasonal allocations are explained. The water trading rules, trading systems among regions, sectors and individual famers as well as the trading platforms and brokers in China are also discussed for managerial implications. Suggestions are provided to improve China's water rights and markets by drawing upon the experiences of current practices according to the proposed framework.},

  abstract = {Decomposition analysis of water footprint (WF) changes, or assessing the changes in WF and identifying the contributions of factors leading to the changes, is important to water resource management. Instead of focusing on WF from the perspective of administrative regions, we built a framework in which the input-output (IO) model, the structural decomposition analysis (SDA) model and the generating regional IO tables (GRIT) method are combined to implement decomposition analysis for WF in a river basin. This framework is illustrated in the WF in Haihe River basin (HRB) from 2002 to 2007, which is a typical water-limited river basin. It shows that the total WF in the HRB increased from 4.3 \texttimes{} 1010 m3 in 2002 to 5.6 \texttimes{} 1010 m3 in 2007, and the agriculture sector makes the dominant contribution to the increase. Both the WF of domestic products (internal) and the WF of imported products (external) increased, and the proportion of external WF rose from 29.1 to 34.4 \%. The technological effect was the dominant contributor to offsetting the increase of WF. However, the growth of WF caused by the economic structural effect and the scale effect was greater, so the total WF increased. This study provides insights about water challenges in the HRB and proposes possible strategies for the future, and serves as a reference for WF management and policy-making in other water-limited river basins.},

  abstract = {The Chinese Loess Plateau is known as one of the most severe soil erosion regions in the world. Two ecological restoration projects, i.e., the integrated soil conservation project since the 1970s and the "Grain for Green" project since 1999, have been progressively implemented to control the soil erosion in this area. Ecological restoration has greatly changed flow regime over the past five decades. However, the mechanism of how flow regime responds to ecological restoration among landforms remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the temporal dynamics of flow regime in three catchments, i.e., Wuqi, Honghe and Huangling hydrological stations, respectively representing the loess hilly-gully, loess table-gully and rocky mountain (covered by secondary forest) areas in the Chinese Loess Plateau, using daily hydrological data during the 1960s-2010s. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test, Pettitt's test and daily flow series were used to investigate the changes of flow regime. Significantly negative trends of annual streamflow were detected at the Wuqi and Honghe stations, except for the Huangling station. The annual baseflow at the Wuqi station showed a significantly positive trend whereas a significantly negative trend was observed at the Honghe station, and there was no significant trend at the Huangling station. It was interesting that baseflow index significantly increased during the whole period in all catchments. However, the trends and change points of daily flow series derived by different percentages of exceedance and extreme series in different consecutive days varied among individuals. Based on the change points analysis of annual streamflow, we divided data series into three periods, i.e., the baseline period (from 1959 and 1963 to 1979, PI), the integrated soil conservation period (1980-1999, PII) and the "Grain for Green" period (2000-2011, PIII). We found that streamflow decreased due to the reduction of high streamflow (exceeding 5\% of time within a year) and median streamflow (50\%) in PII and PIII at the Wuqi and Honghe stations. However, low flow (95\%) increased in PII and PIII at the Wuqi station while decreased at the Honghe station. Streamflow change at the Huangling station was more stable, thus potentially resulting in much less soil erosion in the forestry area than in the other areas. The great improvement in ecological environment on the Chinese Loess Plateau revealed the advantages of ecological restoration in reducing flood amount and compensating streamflow at a regional scale.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River is an important source of sediment flux to oceans in the world, and approximately 90\% of the sediment originates from the middle Yellow River, an area with known high rates of soil erosion and sediment delivery. Trends and interannual variations in sediment discharge have considerable implications for reservoir operation and river management of the lower Yellow River. The annual sediment discharge of four 01_manuscript stream stations and ten tributary stations was used to show the spatiotemporal variation in sediment yield and to quantify the relative contribution of precipitation change and human activities, especially the influence of vegetation restoration with implementation of the Grain for Green Project (GGP) in 1999. The Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests were used to detect the abrupt change in sediment discharge since the 1950s. The annual sediment yield of the middle Yellow River has shown a significant downward trend, decreasing by an order of magnitude in the last decade (2000-2010) compared with the 1950s. Annual sediment yield was reduced by 95.5\% from 3,887.0 t . km(-2) . year(-1) in the 1950s to 174.7 t . km(-2) . year(-1) in the 2000s. The eastern part of the middle Yellow River basin showed the most significant decrease, with sediment yield decreasing up to 90\% in the 2000s compared with the 1950s. Annual precipitation decreased by 7.3\% in the periods 1980-2010 and 1959-1979. Human activities and precipitation explain 83.6 and 16.4\% of the total reduction in sediment yield, respectively, using the double mass curve method. Annual sediment discharge decreased by 597x 106 t . year(-1)-from 660 x 10(6) in 1980-1999 to 63 x 10(6) in 2000-2010. Sediment deposition along the Longmen-Huayuankou section amounted to 120 x 10(6) t . year(-1) during 1980-1999 and 229 x 10(6) t . year(-1) during 2000-2010 based on mass balance. The additional 109 x 106 t . year(-1) of sediment was trapped following completion of the Xiaolangdi Reservoir in the Longmen-Huayuankou section. This explains 18.3\% of the sediment reduction in the 2000s. Soil conservation practices have further reduced sediment discharge by 253 x 10(6) t . year(-1), which explains about 42.4\% of the decrease (597 x 10(6)) during 2000-2010. A reduction of approximately 235 x 106 t . year(-1) occurred because of vegetation restoration driven by the Grain for Green Project, which accounted for 39.4\% of the total reduction (597 x 106 t . year(-1)) in the last decade compared to 1980-1999.

Vegetation cover changes on the Loess Plateau have experienced four stages as follows: (1) vegetation cover showed a continued increasing phase during 1981-1989; (2) vegetation cover changes came into a relative steady phase with small fluctuations during 1990-1998; (3) vegetation cover declined rapidly during 1999-2001; and (4) vegetation cover increased rapidly during 2002-2006. The vegetation cover changes of the Loess Plateau show a notable spatial difference. The vegetation cover has obviously increased in the Inner Mongolia and Ningxia plain along the Yellow River and the ecological rehabilitated region of Ordos Plateau, however the vegetation cover evidently decreased in the hilly and gully areas of Loess Plateau, Liupan Mountains region and the northern hillside of Qinling Mountains. The response of NDVI to climate changes varied with different vegetation types. NDVI of sandy land vegetation, grassland and cultivated land show a significant increasing trend, but forest shows a decreasing trend. The results obtained in this study show that the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover are the outcome of climate changes and human activities. Temperature is a control factor of the seasonal change of vegetation growth. The increased temperature makes soil drier and unfavors vegetation growth in summer, but it favors vegetation growth in spring and autumn because of a longer growing period. There is a significant correlation between vegetation cover and precipitation and thus, the change in precipitation is an important factor for vegetation variation. The improved agricultural production has resulted in an increase of NDVI in the farmland, and the implementation of large-scale vegetation construction has led to some beneficial effect in ecology.},

This study uses the water balance equation to calculate the regional ET with observations of precipitation, runoff, and terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) in nine exorheic catchments of China. We compared the regional ET estimates from a water balance perspective with and without considering TWSC (ETWB: ET estimates with considering TWSC, and ETPQ: ET estimates from precipitation minus runoff without considering TWSC). Results show that the regional annual ET ranges from 417.7 mm/yr to 831.5 mm/yr in the nine exorheic catchments based on the water balance equation. The impact of ignoring TWSC on calculating ET is notable, as the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of annual ET between ETWB and ETPQ range from 12.0\textendash 105.8 mm/yr (2.6\textendash 12.7\% in corresponding annual ET) among the exorheic catchments. We also compared the estimated regional ET with other ET products. Different precipitation products are assessed to explain the inconsistency between different ET products and regional ET from a water balance perspective. The RMSEs between ET estimates from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and ET from land surface models can be reduced if the deviation of precipitation forcing data is considered. ET estimates from Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) can be improved by reducing the uncertainty of precipitation forcing data in three semiarid catchments. This study emphasizes the importance of considering TWSC when calculating the regional ET using a water balance equation and provides more accurate ET estimates to help improve modeled ET results.},

Here, we present a survey-based reconstruction of China's sectoral water use in 341 prefectures during 1965 to 2013. The data indicate that water use has doubled during the entire study period, yet with a widespread slowdown of the growth rates from 10.66 km               3               {$\cdot$}y               -2               before 1975 to 6.23 km               3               {$\cdot$}y               -2               in 1975 to 1992, and further down to 3.59 km               3               {$\cdot$}y               -2               afterward.

Adoptions for highly efficient irrigation and industrial water recycling technologies explained most of the observed reduction of water use intensities across China. These findings challenge conventional views about an acceleration in water use in China and highlight the opposing roles of different drivers for water use projections.},

  abstract = {Potential evapotranspiration (PET) is a key input to hydrological models. Its estimation has often been via the Penman-Monteith (P-M) equation, most recently in the form of an estimate of reference evapotranspiration (RET) as recommended by FAO-56. In this paper the Shuttleworth-Wallace (S-W) model is implemented to estimate PET directly in a form that recognizes vegetation diversity and temporal change without reference to experimental measurements and without calibration. The threshold values of vegetation parameters are drawn from the literature based on the International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme land cover classification. The spatial and temporal variation of the LAI of vegetation is derived from the composite NOAA-AVHRR normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using a method based on the SiB2 model, and the Climate Research Unit database is used to provide the required meteorological data. All these data inputs are publicly and globally available. Consequently, the implementation of the S-W model developed in this study is applicable at the global scale, an essential requirement if it is to be applied in data-poor or ungauged large basins. A comparison is made between the FAO-56 method and the S-W model when applied to the Yellow River basin for the whole of the last century. The resulting estimates of RET and PET and their association with vegetation types and leaf area index (LAI) are examined over the whole basin both annual and monthly and at six specific points. The effect of NDVI on the PET estimate is further evaluated by replacing the monthly NDVI product with the 10-day product. Multiple regression relationships between monthly PET, RET, LAI, and climatic variables are explored for categories of vegetation types. The estimated RET is a good climatic index that adequately reflects the temporal change and spatial distribution of climate over the basin, but the PET estimated using the S-W model not only reflects the changes in climate, but also the vegetation distribution and the development of vegetation in response to climate. Although good statistical relationships can be established between PET, RET and/or climatic variables, applying these relationships likely will result in large errors because of the strong non-linearity and scatter between the PET and the LAI of vegetation. It is concluded that use of the implementation of the S-W model described in this study results in a physically sound estimate of PET that accounts for changing land surface conditions.

  abstract = {The Yellow River (Huanghe) is a major sediment source of sediment to the Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea, resulting in the formation of a large and dynamic delta complex. However, the river sediment discharge reaching the delta has decreased dramatically since the middle 1960s. This study examines the sediment accumulation and morphological changes of the delta complex during 1959-2012 using a repeated bathymetry dataset, high-resolution seismic profiles, and sediment cores obtained in 2012 and 2013. Sediment accumulation rates were determined using the downcore concentrations of Cs-137 and Pb-210. The average accumulation rates calculated for the delta complex range from 6.9-24 cm y(-1) on the delta front slope, 1-2 cm y(-1) at the toe of the slope, and {$<$} 1 cm y(-1) in the northeastern shelf area. Morphological changes and sediment accumulation rates show that 1) the Yellow River delta has entered a destruction phase after 1996, 2) the amount of erosion of the whole delta reaches 210 MT y(-1) of sediment, which is at least required to maintain the whole delta morphology, 3) three-quarters (487 MT y(-1)) of the Yellow River-derived sediment was deposited in the subaerial and subaqueous delta during 1959-2012, and 4) Whereas, one-quarter (144 MT y(-1)) was transported to the Bohai Sea, and as much as one fifth (117 MT y(-1)) was transported further offshore to the Yellow Sea, passing through the Bohai Sea during this period. The source of these sediments is a combination of the Yellow River sediment discharge and the erosion of the previous Yellow River delta lobes. Despite the sharp decline in the Yellow River sediment discharge over the past five decades, the offshore dispersal of the river discharge and eroded sediment to the Yellow Sea was more than 100 MT y(-1) on average. Results of this study show that the erosion of the abandoned delta lobes can sustain the supply of sediment to remote offshore depocenters even after decades of declining river sediment discharge.},

  abstract = {Recent literature has linked export upgrading to income inequality, and found that regions exporting more so\- phisticated products tend to have lower levels of income inequality. Here, we extend the literature by stressing that regional income inequality is shaped not only by export product structure but also by export destination structure. We further scale down our analysis to the intra-regional level, and examine urban-rural inequality within a region. Few have related urban-rural inequality to export upgrading and a region's export product/ destination structures. Hence, we contribute to the current literature by examining how regional export product/ destination structures have shaped income inequality in general and urban-rural inequality in particular. Based on China's export data and income survey data, we show that export upgrading only contributes to the reduction of income inequality in China's urban areas. Urban-rural inequality tends to be more severe in regions that have more complex export product/destination structures, due to the concentration of export activities in urban areas and to some barriers that inhibits the flow of input factors (e.g. capital and labor) between rural and urban areas.},

  abstract = {Previous studies into the relation between human consumption and indirect water resources use have unveiled the remote connections in virtual water (VW) trade networks, which show how communities externalize their water footprint (WF) to places far beyond their own region, but little has been done to understand variability in time. This study quantifies the effect of inter-annual variability of consumption, production, trade and climate on WF and VW trade, using China over the period 1978\textendash 2008 as a case study. Evapotranspiration, crop yields and green and blue WFs of crops are estimated at a 5~\texttimes ~5 arc-minute resolution for 22 crops, for each year in the study period, thus accounting for climate variability. The results show that crop yield improvements during the study period helped to reduce the national average WF of crop consumption per capita by 23\%, with a decreasing contribution to the total from cereals and increasing contribution from oil crops. The total consumptive WFs of national crop consumption and crop production, however, grew by 6\% and 7\%, respectively. By 2008, 28\% of total water consumption in crop fields in China served the production of crops for export to other regions and, on average, 35\% of the crop-related WF of a Chinese consumer was outside its own province. Historically, the net VW within China was from the water-rich South to the water-scarce North, but intensifying North-to-South crop trade reversed the net VW flow since 2000, which amounted 6\% of North's WF of crop production in 2008. South China thus gradually became dependent on food supply from the water-scarce North. Besides, during the whole study period, China's domestic inter-regional VW flows went dominantly from areas with a relatively large to areas with a relatively small blue WF per unit of crop, which in 2008 resulted in a trade-related blue water loss of 7\% of the national total blue WF of crop production. The case of China shows that domestic trade, as governed by economics and governmental policies rather than by regional differences in water endowments, determines inter-regional water dependencies and may worsen rather than relieve the water scarcity in a country.},

  abstract = {The Yellow River Basin (YRB), the second largest river basin of China, has experienced a booming agriculture over the past decades. But data on variability of and trends in water consumption, pollution and scarcity in the YRB are lacking. We estimate, for the first time, the inter- and intra-annual water footprint (WF) of crop production in the YRB for the period 1961\textendash 2009 and the variation of monthly scarcity of blue water (ground and surface water) for 1978\textendash 2009, by comparing the blue WF of agriculture, industry and households in the basin to the maximum sustainable level. Results show that the average overall green (from rainfall) and blue (from irrigation) WFs of crops in the period 2001\textendash 2009 were 14\% and 37\% larger, respectively, than in the period 1961\textendash 1970. The annual nitrogen- and phosphorus-related grey WFs (water required to assimilate pollutants) of crop production grew by factors of 24 and 36, respectively. The green\textendash blue WF per ton of crop reduced significantly due to improved crop yields, while the grey WF increased because of the growing application of fertilizers. The ratio of blue to green WF increased during the study period resulting from the expansion of irrigated agriculture. In the period 1978\textendash 2009, the annual total blue WFs related to agriculture, industry and households varied between 19\% and 52\% of the basin's natural runoff. The blue WF in the YRB generally peaks around May\textendash July, two months earlier than natural peak runoff. On average, the YRB faced moderate to severe blue water scarcity during seven months (January\textendash July) per year. Even in the wettest month in a wet year, about half of the area of the YRB still suffered severe blue water scarcity, especially in the basin's northern part.},

  abstract = {The planetary boundaries framework defines the ``safe operating space for humanity'' represented by nine global processes that can destabilize the Earth System if perturbed. The water planetary boundary attempts to provide a global limit to anthropogenic water cycle modifications, but it has been challenging to translate and apply it to the regional and local scales at which water problems and management typically occur. We develop a cross-scale approach by which the water planetary boundary could guide sustainable water management and governance at subglobal contexts defined by physical features (e.g., watershed or aquifer), political borders (e.g., city, nation, or group of nations), or commercial entities (e.g., corporation, trade group, or financial institution). The application of the water planetary boundary at these subglobal contexts occurs via two approaches: (i) calculating fair shares, in which local water cycle modifications are compared to that context's allocation of the global safe operating space, taking into account biophysical, socioeconomic, and ethical considerations; and (ii) defining a local safe operating space, in which interactions between water stores and Earth System components are used to define local boundaries required for sustaining the local water system in stable conditions, which we demonstrate with a case study of the Cienaga Grande de Santa Marta wetlands in Colombia. By harmonizing these two approaches, the water planetary boundary can ensure that water cycle modifications remain within both local and global boundaries and complement existing water management and governance approaches.},

  abstract = {The changes in runoff and sediment load in the Loess Plateau of China have received considerable attention owing to their dramatic decline during recent decades. In this paper, the impacts of land-use and climate changes on water and sediment yields in the Huangfuchuan River basin (HFCRB) of the Loess Plateau are investigated by combined usage of statistical tests, hydrological modeling, and land-use maps. The temporal trends and abrupt changes in runoff and sediment loads during 1954-2012 are detected by using non-parametric Mann-Kendall and Pettitt tests. The land-use changes between 1980 and 2005 are determined by using transition matrix analysis, and the effects of land-use and climate changes on water and sediment yields are assessed by using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model and four scenarios, respectively. The results show significant decreasing trends in both annual runoff and sediment loads, whereas slightly decreasing and significantly increasing trends are detected for annual precipitation and air temperature, respectively. 1984 is identified as the dividing year of the study period. The land-use changes between 1980 and 2005 show significant effects of the Grain for Green Project in China. Both land-use change and climate change have greater impact on the reduction of sediment yield than that of water. Water and sediment yields in the upstream region show more significant decreases than those in the downstream region under different effects. The results obtained in this study can provide useful information for water resource planning and management as well as soil and water conservation in the Loess Plateau region. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {Individuals are believed to calibrate their antisocial level in response to the socioecological environment where they live. However, knowledge of the relationship between specific socioecological factors and antisocial behavior remains scant. This research focused on humans' residential mobility and explored its influence on antisocial behavior. Three studies were designed to test the hypothesis that individuals with high (vs. low) residential mobility tend to engage in antisocial behavior more frequently. The results showed that both self-reported residential mobility (Study 1) and manipulated residential mobility (Studies 2 and 3) positively predicted individuals' antisocial level. Furthermore, we found that social monitoring played a role in moderating the linkage between residential mobility and antisocial behavior (Study 3); individuals with high residential mobility decreased their antisocial behavior when they were observed by artificial eyes, while individuals with low residential mobility did the opposite. Taken together, this research suggests that, generally speaking, residential mobility is one socioecological factor that increases antisocial behavior, and that social monitoring can have diverse effects on such behavior.},
