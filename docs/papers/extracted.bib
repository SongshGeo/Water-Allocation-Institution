  abstract =      {In recent years, academicians of the Chinese Academy
                   of Sciences have carried out a series of consulting
                   activities to solve the problem of water scarcity in
                   China, and in the consulting proposal on "The Way Out
                   of China's Water Problem" submitted to the State
                   Council in November 1997, it was clearly pointed out
                   that "the water problem will become the most
                   prominent and major problem of China's economic
                   development in the twenty-first century". In view of
                   the serious lack of water resources in North China,
                   the Yellow River tends to prolong the time of
                   breakage year by year, the breakage of the river
                   continues to extend, the frequency of breakage is
                   increasing, in 1998, academicians of the Department
                   of Geology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the
                   Yellow River breakage as a key consulting content,
                   through the convening of symposiums, seminars, and
                   more than 40 experts on the alleviation of the Yellow
                   River breakage countermeasures. Shaanxi and Ningxia
                   provinces and districts, and conducted field visits
                   to more than 20 cities, districts and counties, and
                   held 6 talks with the governments of the four
                   provinces and districts, relevant management
                   departments, more than 100 experts and technicians of
                   the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, local
                   cadres, etc. On the basis of widely listening to the
                   opinions of governments at all levels and the
                   experts, the "Countermeasures and Suggestions on
                   Alleviating the Disruption of the Yellow River" was
                   put forward to the State Council. The Suggestion
                   explains in detail the serious situation of the
                   downstream of the Yellow River, stressing that the
                   frequent break of the downstream of the Yellow River
                   not only directly affects industrial and agricultural
                   production, but more seriously, the downstream of the
                   Yellow River has been in the state of small flow or
                   break of flow for a long period of time, so that the
                   main position of the silt deposited in the downstream
                   channel of the sediments is shifted to the main river
                   channel from the shoal, and siltation has made the
                   middle and downstream of the Yellow River, especially
                   downstream of the increasing difficulties in flood
                   control, and the threat of flooding has intensified
                   from year to year. Once encountered with a large
                   flood, the disaster of the Yellow River breaking and
                   diverting will occur again. The Recommendation points
                   out that "there are natural factors for the Yellow
                   River to break its flow".},
