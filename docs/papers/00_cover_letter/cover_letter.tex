I am pleased to submit an original research article entitled [ “Neofunctionalization of polymerase rho in Ustilago maydis” by Albert Postdoc and My Name] for consideration for publication in [the Journal of Science].  We previously uncovered a role for [polymerase rho in DNA repair in U. maydis (citation)], and this manuscript builds on our prior study to determine the evolution of this unique enzyme.

In this manuscript, we show that [polymerase rho… (list a few important results)].

We believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by [the Journal of Science] because it… [specific link to the journal’s aims \& scope].  [Our manuscript creates a paradigm for future studies of the evolution of essential enzymes in yeast.]

This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere.  We have no conflicts of interest to disclose, but we do respectfully request that [Dr. Glen Meanie] not review our manuscript.  If you feel that the manuscript is appropriate for your journal, we suggest the following reviewers:
