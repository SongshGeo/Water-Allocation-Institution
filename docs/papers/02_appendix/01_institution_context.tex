% 水资源分配方案在全世界范围内都是流域管理的普遍制度。
Water allocation schemes are widespread in large river basin management programs throughout the world (see \textit{Supplementary Material Figure~\ref{fig:world}}) \cite{speed2013}.
% 其中中国的黄河流域以典型的自上而下进行制度改革，这种模式会对制度产生迅速的影响，使我们能够定量地估计高层制度设计变化对用水的净影响。
The Yellow River Basin (YRB) in China has a typical top-down approach to institutional reform, which produces rapid institutional impacts and allows researchers to quantitatively estimate the net impact of changes in high-level institutional design on water use (see \textit{Supplementary Material Figure~\ref{fig:framework}}).
% 作为中国最早实施水资源分配制度的流域，黄河的制度变化可以在几个水利部发布的文件中得以窥见
This was the first basin in China for which a water resource allocation institution was created, and institutional shifts can be traced through several documents released by the Chinese government (at the national level):
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{1982}: The provinces and the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission (YRCC) are required to develop a water resource plan for the Yellow River \cite{wang2019, wang2019a}.
    \item \textbf{1987}: Implementation of the Allocation Plan. (\href{http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2011-03/30/content_3138.htm#}{http://www.mwr.gov.cn}, last access: \today).
    \item \textbf{1998}: Implementation of unified regulation. (\href{http://www.mwr.gov.cn/ztpd/2013ztbd/2013fxkh/fxkhswcbcs/cs/flfg/201304/t20130411_433489.html}{http://www.mwr.gov.cn}, last access: \today).
    % 各省按要求编制新的黄河流域水资源规划，将水资源额度分配进一步细化。
    \item \textbf{2008}: Provinces are asked to draw up new water resources plans for the YRB to further refine water allocations \cite{wangReviewImplementationYellow2019, wangThingsCurrentSignificance2019}.
    \item \textbf{2021}: A call for redesigning the water allocation institution (\href{http://www.ccgp.gov.cn/cggg/zygg/gkzb/202107/t20210721_16591901.htm}{http://www.ccgp.gov.cn}, last access: \today).
\end{itemize}

% 在上述文件中，1982年的文件标志着设计分水制度尝试的开始，2008年标志着该制度走向成熟（完全建立起流域-省-市区的多级水资源分配和统一调度）。
The 1982 document marked the beginning of the attempt to design a water allocation institution, and the 2008 document marked the maturity of the system (complete establishment of basin-level, provincial, and district water allocation and unified regulation). Currently, a major overhaul is in the planning stages. Major shifts of the institution can be analyzed by using the 1987 and 1998 documents. It is worth noting that, although the essential reason for these institutions was the mismatch between the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources as well as social and economic water demands, the direct reason for their introduction was the drying-up of the Yellow River \cite{wangReviewImplementationYellow2019}.

\textbf{The official documents in 1987 clearly convey the following key points:}
\href{http://www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2011-03/30/content_3138.htm#}{http://www.mwr.gov.cn}, last access: \today.
\begin{itemize}
	% 该政策面向的目标是各省（区域），黄委会没有被提及
	\item The policy is aimed at related provinces (or regions), and the YRCC is not mentioned.
	% 政策制定的首要考虑是解决断流问题
	\item Drying-up of the river is identified as the first consideration of this institution.
	% 各省被鼓励在此配额下制定自己的用水计划
	\item Provinces are encouraged to develop their own water use plans based on a quota system.
	% 水资源供给无法满足需求对相关省（地区）是普遍现象。
	\item Water in short supply is a common phenomenon in relevant provinces (regions).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The official documents in 1998 clearly convey the following key points:}
\href{http://www.mwr.gov.cn/ztpd/2013ztbd/2013fxkh/fxkhswcbcs/cs/flfg/201304/t20130411_433489.html}{http://www.mwr.gov.cn}, last access: \today.
\begin{itemize}
	% 除了说明政策针对的各省区之外，明确指出其用水需要黄河水利委员会进行申报，并由其组织和监管
	\item The document clearly points out that not only provinces and autonomous regions involved in water resources management (see \textit{Article 3}), the provinces’ and regions’ water use shall be declared, organized, and supervised by the YRCC (\textit{Article 11 and Chapter III to Chapter V, and Chapter VII}).
	% 本研究(\textit{ Article 1})首先考虑的是上、中、下游用水的总体规划。
	\item Creating the overall plan of water use in the upper, middle, and lower reaches is identified as the first consideration of this institution (\textit{Article 1}).
	% 各省需要
	\item With the same quota as used in the 1987 policy, provinces were encouraged to further distribute their quota into lower-level administrations (see \textit{Article 6 and Article 41}).
	% 强调以总量确定供给，以供给决定需求。
	\item They emphasize that supply is determined by total quantity, and water use should not exceed the quota proposed in 1987 (see \textit{Article 2}).
\end{itemize}

% 基于上述分析，我们抽象出了如正文图2中所展示的流域水资源分配制度的运行结构，并将研究时段选择在1975到2008之间。
% On the basis of the above analysis, we abstracted the operational structure of the water resource allocation institution of the YRB as shown in Figure 2 of the main text, focusing on the period between 1975 and 2008. By comparing the net effects of three different institutional structures split by the two institutional shifts, we were able to reach a stronger understanding of the influence of structural alignments under the same basin (previous structure-based analysis usually focus on a certain type of systems but with different geographic contexts).
