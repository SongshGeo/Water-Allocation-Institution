                   adaptive capacities. Beyond geophysical stressors and

                   multi-sector, multi-scale economic teleconnections
                   mitigate or exacerbate water shortages. Here, we
                   contribute a global-to-basin-scale exploratory
                   analysis of potential water scarcity impacts by
                   linking a global human-Earth system model, a global
                   hydrologic model, and a metric for the loss of
                   economic surplus due to resource shortages. We find
                   that, dependent on scenario assumptions, major
                   hydrologic basins can experience strongly positive or
                   strongly negative economic impacts due to global
                   trade dynamics and market adaptations to regional
                   scarcity. In many cases, market adaptation profoundly
                   magnifies economic uncertainty relative to hydrologic
                   uncertainty. Our analysis finds that impactful
                   scenarios are often combinations of standard
                   scenarios, showcasing that planners cannot presume
                   drivers of uncertainty in complex adaptive systems.},

                   assessments, measuring water scarcity annually, have
                   underestimated experienced water scarcity by failing
                   to capture the seasonal fluctuations in water
                   consumption and availability. We assess blue water
                   scarcity globally at a high spatial resolution on a
                   monthly basis. We find that two-thirds of the global

                   of severe water scarcity at least 1 month of the

  volume =        {107},

                   human health, agricultural production, economic
                   activity as well as critical ecosystem functions. As
                   populations and economies grow, new constraints on
                   water resources are appearing, raising questions
                   about limits to water availability. Such resource
                   questions are not new. The specter of “peak
                   oil”—a peaking and then decline in oil
                   production—has long been predicted and debated. We
                   present here a detailed assessment and definition of
                   three concepts of “peak water”: peak renewable
                   water, peak nonrenewable water, and peak ecological
                   water. These concepts can help hydrologists, water
                   managers, policy makers, and the public understand
                   and manage different water systems more effectively
                   and sustainably. Peak renewable water applies where
                   flow constraints limit total water availability over
                   time. Peak nonrenewable water is observable in
                   groundwater systems where production rates
                   substantially exceed natural recharge rates and where
                   overpumping or contamination leads to a peak of
                   production followed by a decline, similar to more
                   traditional peak-oil curves. Peak “ecological”
                   water is defined as the point beyond which the total
                   costs of ecological disruptions and damages exceed
                   the total value provided by human use of that water.
                   Despite uncertainties in quantifying many of these
                   costs and benefits in consistent ways, more and more
                   watersheds appear to have already passed the point of
                   peak water. Applying these concepts can help shift
                   the way freshwater resources are managed toward more
                   productive, equitable, efficient, and sustainable
                   use.},

  abstract =      {Large hydrologic basins involve multiple
                   stakeholders, and coupled dynamic social and
                   ecological processes. Managing such basins has long
                   been a challenge. Balancing the demand for water from
                   nature against that from humans is always difficult,
                   particularly in arid watersheds. Here, we analyze
                   potential institutional causes of ecological
                   degradation and how it can be reversed by introducing
                   new forms of governance. The framework and
                   assumptions are illustrated using China's
                   second-largest endorheic basin, where empirical
                   evidence shows that the introduction of a new
                   governing authority connecting midstream and
                   downstream actors facilitated the establishment of a
                   new governance regime that is better aligned with the
                   biophysical scales of the watershed. A trans-regional
                   water allocation project initiated by the new
                   higher-level authority successfully rescued
                   downstream oases and restored a dried terminal lake.
                   These outcomes suggest that when social and
                   ecological structures are better aligned our ability
                   to manage the interplay between social and ecological
                   processes increases. However, the lack of direct
                   connection between the actors of the middle and lower
                   reaches resulted in the paradox of an increase in
                   water demand. We therefore suggest that measures to
                   stimulate the emergence of horizontal social ties
                   linking different critical groups of actors across
                   the watershed could further the alignment of the
                   institutional and biophysical structures-without
                   these changes sustainable management of river basins

  abstract =      {Many large-scale water resources systems, especially
                   in transboundary contexts, are characterized by the
                   presence of several and conflicting interests and
                   managed by multiple, institutionally independent
                   decision makers. These systems are often studied
                   adopting a centralized approach based on the
                   assumption of full cooperation and information
                   exchange among the involved parties. Such a
                   perspective is conceptually interesting to quantify
                   the best achievable performance but might have little
                   practical impact given the real political and
                   institutional setting. In this work, we propose a
                   novel decision-analytic framework based on multiagent
                   systems to model and analyze different levels of
                   cooperation and information exchange among multiple
                   decision makers. The Zambezi River basin is used as a
                   case study. According to the proposed agent-based
                   optimization approach, each agent represents a
                   decision maker, whose decisions are defined by an
                   explicit optimization problem considering only the
                   agent's local interests. The economic value of
                   information exchange is estimated comparing a
                   noncooperative setting, where agents act
                   independently, with the first basic level of
                   cooperation, i.e., coordination, characterized by
                   full information exchange. The economic value of
                   cooperation is also estimated by comparison with the
                   ideal, fully cooperative management of the system.
                   Results show that coordination, obtained with
                   complete information exchange, allows the downstream
                   agents to better adapt to the upstream behaviors. The
                   impact of information exchange depends on the
                   objective considered, and we show coordination to be
                   particularly beneficial to environmental interests.},

                   adapting to changing conditions and transforming in
                   situations of crisis are fundamentally dependent on
                   the functions of water to e.g., regulate the
                   Earth’s climate, support biomass production, and
                   supply water resources for human societies. However,
                   massive, inter-connected, human interference
                   involving climate forcing, water withdrawal, dam
                   constructions, and land-use change have significantly
                   disturbed these water functions and induced regime
                   shifts in social-ecological systems. In many cases,
                   changes in core water functions have pushed systems
                   beyond tipping points and led to fundamental shifts
                   in system feedback. Examples of such transgressions,
                   where water has played a critical role, are collapse
                   of aquatic systems beyond water quality and quantity
                   thresholds, desertification due to soil and ecosystem
                   degradation, and tropical forest dieback associated
                   with self-amplifying moisture and carbon feedbacks.
                   Here, we aggregate the volumes and flows of water
                   involved in water functions globally, and review the
                   evidence of freshwater related linear collapse and
                   non-linear tipping points in ecological and social
                   systems through the lens of resilience theory. Based
                   on the literature review, we synthesize the role of
                   water in mediating different types of ecosystem
                   regime shifts, and generalize the process by which
                   life support systems are at risk of collapsing due to
                   loss of water functions. We conclude that water plays
                   a fundamental role in providing social-ecological
                   resilience, and suggest that further research is
                   needed to understand how the erosion of water
                   resilience at local and regional scale may
                   potentially interact, cascade, or amplify through the

                   increasing due to climate change. Evaluation of
                   potential policy responses involves understanding
                   complex economic tradeoffs, hydrologic and social
                   feedbacks, and recognizing how combinations of
                   interventions may have complementary or conflicting

                   coupled human-natural system models have to address
                   these questions. We employ a detailed model of the

                   effectiveness of a variety of potential drought
                   policy interventions to conserve or reallocate water
                   during a simulated near-term drought year. The
                   drought year is characterized by early-season low
                   flows that make it impossible to meet water demands.
                   The results indicate that while the policies are
                   effective at conserving water, they have limited

                   combining a dataset of urban water sources of 482 of

                   and predictions of future water availability, using
                   the WaterGAP3 modelling framework. We project an
                   urban surface-water deficit of 1,386–6,764 million

                   improvements in agricultural water-use efficiency

                   compounded by conflict-induced population shocks.
                   Integrating knowledge across hydrology, climatology,

                   economics, we present the Jordan Water Model, a

                   model that is used to evaluate Jordan’s freshwater
                   security under climate and socioeconomic changes. The
                   complex systems model simulates the trajectory of
                   Jordan’s water system, representing dynamic

                   Ecological decline and social conflict in many

                   BACKGROUNDCurrent and future generations are
                   confronted with the complex task of devising
                   sustainable solutions to environmental problems. The
                   coming decade might determine whether humanity will
                   be able to set a course toward a future of continued
                   prosperity on a planet whose ecosystems will deliver
                   the needed goods and services. A crucial piece of
                   this puzzle is achieving effective collaboration
                   among different public and private actors and
                   stakeholders. Calls for solving environmental
                   problems through collaborative governance emphasize
                   benefits from local to global scales—from artisanal
                   fishermen avoiding the overfishing of local fish
                   stocks by together agreeing upon sustainable
                   practices, to states jointly committing to implement
                   adequate measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
                   Although commonly advocated, achieving successful
                   collaborations when confronted with complex
                   environmental problems spanning geographical scales
                   and jurisdictional boundaries is an area where
                   substantial knowledge gaps remain. ADVANCESA growing
                   amount of empirical evidence shows the effectiveness
                   of actors engaged in different collaborative
                   governance arrangements in addressing environmental
                   problems. However, studies also show that actors
                   sometimes collaborate only as a means of advocating
                   their own interests, while largely lacking a
                   willingness to contribute towards jointly negotiated
                   solutions to common problems. Hence, collaboration is
                   sometimes unable to deliver any tangible outcomes, or
                   merely produces symbolic outcomes such as aggregated
                   wish lists where conflicts of interest are left
                   untouched.Clearly, no single blueprint exists for how
                   to succeed by using collaborative approaches to solve
                   environmental problems. One way of approaching this
                   puzzle is through the lenses of the participating
                   actors and the ways in which they engage in
                   collaboration with each other. This approach entails
                   directing attention to who the actors are, what their
                   interests and motives are, who they collaborate with,
                   and how the structures of such “collaborative
                   networks” relate to the actors’ joint abilities
                   to address different environmental problems.Emerging
                   insights from recent research suggest that the
                   effectiveness of different collaborative network
                   structures in addressing environmental problems
                   depends on how those problems unfold with respect to
                   the following characteristics: (i) varying levels of
                   risk that actors free-ride on others’ efforts; (ii)
                   varying levels of knowledge gaps, signifying
                   different needs for social learning and deliberation
                   among actors with different backgrounds, experiences,
                   and interests; and (iii) whether these problems are,
                   for all practical purposes, permanent or just
                   temporary.Also, long-standing research questions
                   regarding whether governance structures that are
                   adequately aligned with ecosystem structures and
                   processes are more effective have recently been
                   addressed empirically. Early results suggest several
                   ways in which misalignments between the structure of
                   a collaborative network and the biophysical
                   environment reduce the ability to address
                   environmental problems effectively. OUTLOOKA more
                   nuanced understanding of whether collaborative
                   governance is the most effective way of solving
                   environmental problems is needed. The capacity of
                   collaborative governance to deliver sustainable
                   solutions for any given environmental problem ranges
                   from highly effective to essentially worthless.
                   Future efforts must establish which factors determine
                   the exact location of any collaborative arrangement
                   on this continuum.Emerging insights suggest that
                   where a collaborative arrangement falls on the
                   spectrum results from a complex interplay between
                   several factors. The characteristics of the
                   underlying collective action problem are one factor.
                   Others are the characteristics of the underlying
                   biophysical system and how these align with the ways
                   in which collaborative governance arrangements are
                   constructed, institutionally embedded, and managed.
                   Finally, the patterns in which actors collaborate
                   with each other (or do not) is a factor that
                   potentially determines the effects that the other
                   factors have on a collaborative arrangement’s
                   ability to solve environmental problems. {$<$}img

  ecosystems is challenging because of the high number of stakeholders, the
  permeability of man-made political and jurisdictional demarcations in
  relation to the temporal and spatial extent of biophysical processes, and a
  limited understanding of complex ecosystem and societal dynamics. Given these
  conditions, collaborative governance is commonly put forward as the preferred
  means of addressing environmental problems. Under this paradigm, a deeper
  understanding of if, when, and how collaboration is effective, and when other
  means of addressing environmental problems are better suited, is needed.
  Interdisciplinary research on collaborative networks demonstrates that which
  actors get involved, with whom they collaborate, and in what ways they are
  tied to the structures of the ecosystems have profound implications on
  actors’ abilities to address different types of environmental problems.},

  abstract =      {Understanding the complex interlinkages between
                   humans and nature is crucial for developing
                   strategies to effectively manage natural resources
                   and to enhance resilience of social–ecological
                   systems (SES). Network analysis bears great potential
                   to advance such comprehension of SESs because it
                   allows for identifying and analysing direct and
                   indirect relationships and processes. As a result,
                   the number of network studies in social–ecological
                   research has rapidly grown over the last decade. This
                   work systematizes existing network approaches for
                   analysing human–nature relationships based on the
                   level of integration of both the social and
                   ecological realms in the network conceptualization. A
                   structured inductive review of existing empirical
                   network studies exploring a wide range of phenomena
                   at the human–nature interface was conducted,
                   resulting in 138 studies falling into three proposed
                   categories. We examine their network
                   conceptualization and means of analysis, and discuss
                   challenges and potentials of each of the three
                   categories in empirical research. The study
                   highlights the diversity and creativity with which
                   distinct social and ecological entities are defined
                   to enable the use of a variety of network analytical
                   approaches in SES research. Demonstrating the
                   increasing recognition of network analysis to
                   describe human–nature relationships since the early
                   2000s and providing an overview of the many useful
                   conceptual and methodological approaches, this
                   article contributes to systematizing the existing
                   studies and provides practical guidance for network
                   research to help disentangling complex SES. A free

                   scholarship on the commons, the paper pursues two
                   strategies of critique. The first strategy of
                   friendly critique accepts the basic assumptions of
                   most writings on common property to show that
                   scholars of commons have discovered far more
                   variables that potentially affect resource management
                   than is possible to analyze carefully. The paper
                   identifies some potential means to address the
                   problem of too many variables. The second line of
                   critique proceeds differently. It asks how analyses
                   of common property might change, and what they need
                   to consider, if they loosen assumptions about
                   sovereign selves and apolitical property rights
                   institutions. My examination of these questions
                   concludes this review with an emphasis on the need to

                   will self-organize and sustainably govern resources
                   upon which they depend. Using three of the more
                   comprehensive such studies, and with an extensive
                   review of writings on the commons, this paper
                   demonstrates that the enterprise of generating lists

                   sometimes inconsistent program of research. Therefore
                   we review the recent literature on the fit between
                   institutions and social–ecological systems to
                   identify three general types of fit: namely,
                   ecological fit, social fit and social–ecological
                   system fit. Each of these draws attention to
                   different dimensions of social–ecological systems,
                   with their own unique set of evaluative criteria.
                   Although diversity is generally beneficial for the
                   production of knowledge, it can also pose immense
                   challenges as scholars and practitioners seek to

                   resources allocations under the implementation of the
                   West Route of South- to- North Water Transfer
                   Project. The conclusions are as follows: (1) The
                   examination of the 1987 water resources allocation
                   revealed that the allocations are more close to the
                   sequential sharing rules- proportional rule (SSRs-
                   PRO) bankruptcy rule, indicating a combination of
                   provincial geographical location and
                   upstreamdownstream coordination. (2) The analysis in
                   view of the current situation of economic and social
                   development, ecological environment, and water and
                   sediment relationship in the basin showed that the
                   basin is facing bankruptcy distribution again. (3)
                   Under ecological protection and highquality
                   development strategy in the river basin, the
                   re-allocation analysis incorporating agricultural
                   water use efficiency indicated that the provinces
                   with high water productivity, including Shandong,
                   Henan, and Sichuan Provinces, will enjoy increased
                   allocation under all bankruptcy rules; while Shanxi,
                   Qinghai, Gansu, and Ningxia, where water productivity
                   is low, will have decreased allocation. (4) The
                   comparison between diversion scales of 5, 9, and 17
                   billion m3 of the West Route of South-to-North Water
                   Transfer Project showed that 9 billion m3 division
                   and application of SSRs-PRO of the“Yellow River
                   Water Allocation Scheme in 1987”is a reasonable
                   choice for the Yellow River Basin. Applying
                   bankruptcy theory to the Yellow River Basin provides
                   a new perspective for water resources allocation and
                   re-allocation in the basin.},

                   Yellow River, but it should not be exaggerated. The
                   direct cause of the break of the Yellow River is the
                   increase of water consumption in the basin, but the
                   root cause is the poor management and improper
                   allocation of water resources in the basin. From the
                   relevant data, it can be seen that 1997, 2000 and
                   2001 were the years when the inflow was greatly
                   reduced. In 1997, the flow was cut off for 228 days,
                   while in 2000 and 2001, the Yellow River did not cut
                   off. It can be seen that human beings can do
                   something through their own behavior adjustment in

                   background，research process and continuous
                   development of the Yellow River water allocation
                   scheme in 1987 ( Scheme 1987 in short) ，and
                   analyzed the implement processes and effects of the
                   two periods before and after the integrated water
                   regulation in 1999. The new challenges and solutions
                   of the water resources under changing environment in
                   the basin were proposed. Scheme 1987 is the first
                   basin-scale water allocation scheme for large rivers
                   in China. It has great breakthroughs and
                   demonstration signifi- cance for China to promote the
                   scientific allocation and efficient use of water
                   resources. Scheme 1987 has been continuously
                   refined，deep- ened，developed and improved by
                   series of work such as refinement among tributaries
                   and regions，improvement of the water allocation
                   scheme under the new runoff conditions and the
                   formulation of the red line for water consumption
                   control，which strongly supports the water resources
                   management of the Yellow River basin and constitutes
                   an important watershed management technical
                   documentation. In the past 30 years，Scheme 1987 and
                   the Yellow River water resources management practice
                   have effectively restrained the water demand growth
                   of the ba- sin，coordinated the water use relations
                   of the 11 provinces and regions along the
                   river，supported the sustainable socioeconomic
                   development of the basin and the maintenance of the
                   ecological environment，and realized the mainstream
                   continuous flowing for 20 consecutive years. In the
                   future，the demand for water resources in the Yellow
                   River basin will continue to show a certain rigid
                   growth. The key issue of water re- sources management
                   in the basin is how to alleviate the constraints of
                   water resources on socioeconomic development of the
                   basin，and support the benign maintenance of the
                   ecological environment.},

  abstract =      {The problem of transboundary river water distribution
                   is related to river health, human water relationship,
                   regional coordinated development, and security and
                   stability of societies. Water distribution of the
                   Yellow River is one of the major difficulties faced
                   in the implementation of the Yellow River national
                   strategy, which is related to the national economy
                   and people’s livelihood. At present, there are many
                   studies on transboundary river water distribution in
                   China and internationally, but accurate and
                   reasonable conclusions have yet to be reached. The
                   1987 water distribution scheme for the Yellow River
                   has been implemented for more than 30 years and
                   changes are urgently needed. In this study, through
                   data collection and analysis of a large amount of
                   literature, the thoughts, principles, and rules of
                   water distribution in transboundary rivers were
                   summarized, and a set of systematic calculation
                   methods of water distribution in transboundary rivers
                   was put forward. This new approach is characterized
                   by multi- method synthesis- dynamic analysis-
                   harmonious water distribution based on the thoughts,
                   principles, and rules of water distribution (SDH
                   method for short). On this basis, the theoretical
                   method was applied and the actual situation of the
                   Yellow River Basin and the results of existing
                   scientific research were fully considered. The
                   results are as follows: (1) Water distribution in
                   transboundary rivers is a difficult problem, which
                   involves the complicated relationships between human
                   and nature and between people; (2) The proposed water
                   distribution method takes into account factors such
                   as current water distribution scheme, current water
                   use, future water demand, population, GDP, river
                   basin area, and the overall optimal distribution,
                   changes year on year with the change of the quantity
                   of distributable water, and meets the minimum water
                   demand and water use efficiency constraints; (3) The
                   1987 water distribution scheme for the Yellow River
                   needs to be adjusted. Considering the change of the
                   total distributable water amount, a new scheme for
                   the Yellow River water distribution under the two
                   scenarios of 37 billion and 30 billion m3 of assumed
                   distributable water is determined respectively (the
                   “19ZQT” water distribution scheme), and the
                   suitability of the scheme was analyzed and
                   demonstrated.},

                   individuals in common is an issue of increasing
                   concern to policy analysts. Both state control and
                   privatisation of resources have been advocated, but
                   neither the state nor the market have been uniformly
                   successful in solving common pool resource problems.
                   Offering a critique of the foundations of policy
                   analysis as applied to natural resources, Elinor
                   Ostrom here provides a unique body of empirical data
                   to explore conditions under which common pool
                   resource problems have been satisfactorily or
                   unsatisfactorily solved. Dr Ostrom first describes
                   three models most frequently used as the foundation
                   for recommending state or market solutions. She then
                   outlines theoretical and empirical alternatives to
                   these models in order to illustrate the diversity of
                   possible solutions. In the following chapters she
                   uses institutional analysis to examine different ways
                   - both successful and unsuccessful - of governing the
                   commons. In contrast to the proposition of the
                   tragedy of the commons argument, common pool problems
                   sometimes are solved by voluntary organisations
                   rather than by a coercive state. Among the cases
                   considered are communal tenure in meadows and
                   forests, irrigation communities and other water
                   rights, and fisheries.},

                   the recent development of several conceptual
                   frameworks integrating human society with nature,
                   there has been less methodological and theoretical
                   progress on how to quantitatively study such

                   that partly builds on the rapidly growing
                   interdisciplinary research on complex networks. The
                   framework makes it possible to unpack, define and
                   formalize ways in which societies and nature are

                   resources. The set represents all possible patterns
                   of interdependency in a SES. Each unique motif is

                   connectivity, resource sharing, and resource
                   substitutability. By aligning theoretical insights
                   related to the management of common-pool resources,
                   metapopulation dynamics, and the problem of fit in
                   SES with the set of motifs, we demonstrate the

                   Mismatches in Estuary Watershed Restoration},
  volume =        {114},
  abstract =      {Resource management boundaries seldom align with
                   environmental systems, which can lead to social and
                   ecological problems. Mapping and analyzing how
                   resource management organizations in different areas
                   collaborate can provide vital information to help
                   overcome such misalignment. Few quantitative
                   approaches exist, however, to analyze social
                   collaborations alongside environmental patterns,
                   especially among local and regional organizations
                   (i.e., in multilevel governance settings). This paper
                   develops and applies such an approach using
                   social–ecological network analysis (SENA), which
                   considers relationships among and between social and
                   ecological units. The framework and methods are shown
                   using an estuary restoration case from Puget Sound,
                   United States. Collaboration patterns and quality are
                   analyzed among local and regional organizations
                   working in hydrologically connected areas. These
                   patterns are correlated with restoration
                   practitioners’ assessments of the productivity of
                   their collaborations to inform network theories for
                   natural resource governance. The SENA is also
                   combined with existing ecological data to jointly
                   consider social and ecological restoration concerns.
                   Results show potentially problematic areas in
                   nearshore environments, where collaboration networks
                   measured by density (percentage of possible network
                   connections) and productivity are weakest. Many areas
                   also have high centralization (a few nodes hold the
                   network together), making network cohesion dependent
                   on key organizations. Although centralization and
                   productivity are inversely related, no clear
                   relationship between density and productivity is
                   observed. This research can help practitioners to
                   identify where governance capacity needs
                   strengthening and jointly consider social and
                   ecological concerns. It advances SENA by developing a
                   multilevel approach to assess social–ecological (or
                   social–environmental) misalignments, also known as
                   scale mismatches.},

                   then systematically review one end of this spectrum,
                   what we term ‘fully articulated SEN’ studies,

                   future work and would help develop SENs as a unique
                   field of research, not just a method. Authors have
                   studied diverse systems, while mainly focusing on the
                   problem of social-ecological fit alongside a
                   scattering of other topics. There is strong
                   potential, however, to engage other issues central to
                   human-environment studies. Analyzing the simultaneous
                   effects of multiple social, environmental, and
                   coupled processes, change over time, and linking
                   network structures to outcomes are also areas for
                   future advancement. This review provides a
                   comprehensive assessment of (fully articulated) SEN

                   provinces. We apply the
                   difference-in-differences-in-differences (DDD) method
                   to a unique dataset on industry-level activities in
                   counties along 24 major rivers in China from 1998

                   of a province has up to 20 percent more
                   water-polluting activities than otherwise identical

  volume =        {91},
  abstract =      {Sustainability issues cannot be separated from their
                   social and biophysical context, and collaborative
                   governance responses to interdependent sustainability
                   issues are inherently complex. Governance gaps emerge
                   when responsible actors fail to recognize how
                   multiple issues and actors are interlinked. Closing
                   governance gaps is particularly challenging for
                   sustainability issues that intersect several sectors
                   of society, such as livelihoods, agriculture and
                   biodiversity conservation. This study introduces a
                   new quantitative empirical approach that
                   conceptualizes how governance gaps emerge at the
                   intersection of two networks that are usually studied
                   separately: an actor network and a network of
                   interdependent sustainability issues. We
                   differentiate between (1) integrative gaps that arise
                   when interdependent issues are managed in separation
                   without recognizing their interdependencies, versus
                   (2) collaborative gaps that arise when actors working
                   on common issues do not collaborate. Using data on 60
                   actors and 38 sustainability issues in southwest
                   Ethiopia, we found comprehensive collaboration
                   networks around, for example, agricultural production
                   and land-use issues, but large collaborative gaps for
                   forest and wildlife issues. While actors actively
                   managed interdependencies around national
                   high-priority issues such as coffee export and family
                   planning, integrative gaps were common for
                   low-profile issues such as access provision of
                   finance, transportation, schools, food and crop
                   markets. In general, smaller specialized actors had a
                   stronger tendency than larger generalist actors to
                   focus their management capacity towards the closing
                   of governance gaps. Surprisingly, greater system
                   complexity did not per se cause governance gaps,
                   except when system interactions were cross-sectoral.
                   Furthermore, our data suggested that integrative
                   system management and collaboration reinforced each
                   other. In conclusion, our network framework advances
                   how governance gaps can be understood and prioritized
                   in different empirical contexts. It enables a
                   theoretically informed empirical identification of
                   the specific sustainability issues for which targeted
                   structural changes are most likely to facilitate
                   improved sustainability outcomes.},

                   management scales align with scales of ecological
                   heterogeneity. We analyzed the areas of institutions
                   (10,030 permissions from 7,478 permits in the Great
                   Barrier Reef Marine Park, 2007–2017) and compared
                   these with the areas of reef features and non-reef
                   marine bioregions. Permission extents were bimodal;
                   72\% were fine scale (median 16.5 km2), and 28\% were
                   broad scale (median 99,193 km2). Biophysical data
                   were unimodal and at significantly smaller scales

                   different activities indicated adaptability within

                   new approach to quantifying scale mismatches. It
                   suggests that discrete institutional scales exist but
                   differ from ecological scales and that rules at
                   broader scales than the managed resource may allow
                   greater adaptation and responsiveness by human users

  abstract =      {High-profile modelling studies often project that
                   large-scale win–win solutions are widely available,
                   but practitioners are often sceptical of win–win
                   narratives, due to real-world complexity. Here we
                   bridge this divide by showing mathematically why
                   complexity makes win–wins elusive. We provide a
                   general proof that increasing the number of
                   objectives, the number of stakeholders or the number
                   of constraints decreases the availability of
                   win–win outcomes (here meaning Pareto
                   improvements). We also show that a measure of
                   tradeoff severity increases in the number of
                   objectives. As the number of objectives approaches
                   infinity, we show that this tradeoff severity measure
                   approaches a limit unaffected by the curvature of the
                   tradeoff surface. This is surprising because concave
                   tradeoff-surface curvature results in less severe
                   tradeoffs with fewer objectives. Our theory suggests
                   that this difference gradually dissipates as
                   objectives are added. In a meta-analysis, we show
                   that 77\% of empirically estimated two-objective
                   tradeoff surfaces are concave. We then show how to
                   approximately extrapolate our tradeoff severity
                   measure to higher numbers of objectives, starting
                   from estimated tradeoffs between fewer objectives.
                   Our results provide modellers with precise intuition
                   into practitioners’ scepticism of win–win
                   narratives and practitioners with guidance for

                   provides an important foundation for basinscale water
                   resources management. The Scheme 1987 has been in
                   place for more than 30 years,during which time both
                   the natural environment and the socioeconomics in the
                   Yellow River basin have changed dramatically. Thus
                   there is an urgent need to assess the adaptability of
                   Scheme 1987 in changing environments. We have
                   developed a dynamic differential equation and
                   comprehensive evaluation model to assess water
                   allocation scheme adaptability using power system
                   principles. We have constructed an index system
                   consisting of 20 metrics of
                   sensibility,stability,resistance, and resilience and
                   used our method to assess Scheme 1987 between 1999
                   and 2017. The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter has been
                   used to reveal the adaptability trend. The results
                   show that Scheme 1987 adapted well to the changing
                   environment, with highly adaptable years accounting
                   for more than 63.2\% of the 19-year period.
                   Adaptability increased early,peaking in 2005,and then
                   decreased. The scheme began showing an inability to
                   adapt since 2014. We have identified the major
                   factors influencing the adaptability of Scheme 1987
                   and suggested some adjustments for basin-scale water
                   resources management.},

  abstract =      {The resource management and environmental policy
                   literature focuses on devising regulations and
                   incentive structures to achieve desirable goals. It
                   often presumes the existence of public infrastructure
                   that actualizes these incentives and regulations
                   through a process loosely referred to as
                   ‘governance.’ In many cases, it is not clear if
                   and how such governance infrastructure can be created
                   and supported. Here, we take a complex systems view
                   in which ‘governance’ is an emergent phenomenon
                   generated by interactions between social, economic,
                   and environmental (both built and natural) factors.
                   We present a framework and formal stylized model to
                   explore under what circumstances stable governance
                   structures may emerge endogenously in coupled
                   infrastructure systems comprising shared natural,
                   social, and built infrastructures of which
                   social-ecological systems are specific examples. The
                   model allows us to derive general conditions for a
                   sustainable coupled infrastructure system in which
                   critical infrastructure (e.g., canals) is provided by
                   a governing entity that enables resource users (e.g.,
                   farmers) to produce outputs from natural
                   infrastructure (e.g., water) to meet their needs
                   while supporting the governing entity.},

  abstract =      {Increased human water use combined with climate
                   change have aggravated water scarcity from the
                   regional to global scales. However, the lack of
                   spatially detailed datasets limits our understanding
                   of the historical water use trend and its key
                   drivers. Here, we present a survey-based
                   reconstruction of China’s sectoral water use in 341
                   prefectures during 1965 to 2013. The data indicate
                   that water use has doubled during the entire study
                   period, yet with a widespread slowdown of the growth
                   rates from 10.66 km 3 ⋅y −2 before 1975 to 6.23
                   km 3 ⋅y −2 in 1975 to 1992, and further down to
                   3.59 km 3 ⋅y −2 afterward. These decelerations
                   were attributed to reduced water use intensities of
                   irrigation and industry, which partly offset the
                   increase driven by pronounced socioeconomic
                   development (i.e., economic growth, population
                   growth, and structural transitions) by 55\% in 1975
                   to 1992 and 83\% after 1992. Adoptions for highly
                   efficient irrigation and industrial water recycling
                   technologies explained most of the observed reduction
                   of water use intensities across China. These findings
                   challenge conventional views about an acceleration in
                   water use in China and highlight the opposing roles
                   of different drivers for water use projections.},

                   River Water Allocation Scheme ( Scheme 1987 in short)
                   ，which is the first wa- ter allocation scheme in
                   whole basin in China. The Scheme 1987 not only laid
                   the foundation for the allocation of water resources
                   in the Yellow River in the coming decades but also
                   has a strong guiding significance for the water
                   distribution in China. It is the historical monument
                   of water rights allocation in China. This paper
                   reviewed the motivation and process of the water
                   allocation of the Yellow River，analyzed the
                   connotation and significance of the allocation

                   basis for supporting the democratic consultation of
                   the scheme，democratic centralism is the principle
